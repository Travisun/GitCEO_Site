### Introduction to XML

XML, or eXtensible Markup Language, is a powerful tool for storing and transporting data. Unlike HTML, which is used to display data, XML focuses on the definition and structuring of the data itself. This makes XML vital for data interchange between different systems, especially in web applications. For beginners, understanding XML can open up a myriad of opportunities in fields such as web development, data analysis, and software engineering. With a plethora of online resources available, learning XML has never been easier.
