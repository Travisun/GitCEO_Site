### Introduction to Bootstrap 5

Bootstrap 5 is a powerful open-source front-end framework designed to simplify the process of web development. It enables developers to build responsive and mobile-first websites with ease. With the rise of mobile devices, responsiveness has become a critical aspect of web design. Bootstrap offers a grid system, pre-built components, and utility classes that help ensure your website looks great on screens of all sizes. In this guide, we will walk you through the fundamental aspects of Bootstrap 5, from installation to creating responsive layouts.

### 1. Installing Bootstrap 5

#### Step 1: Download Bootstrap

To get started, you can either download Bootstrap directly from the official [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com) or use a CDN (Content Delivery Network). The easiest way for beginners is to use the CDN method.

Here's how you can include Bootstrap in your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Bootstrap 5 Website</title>
    <!-- Bootstrap CSS from CDN -->
    <link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    ...
    <!-- Bootstrap JS and dependencies -->
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.9.2/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.0.0/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
In the code above, we include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files from a CDN, which is a quick way to get started without needing to host the files yourself.

### 2. Understanding Bootstrap's Grid System

The grid system is one of Bootstrap's most vital features. It enables developers to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes using predefined grid classes. The grid is based on a series of containers, rows, and columns. 

#### Step 2: Creating a Simple Grid Layout

Here is an example of a simple grid layout using Bootstrap 5:

```html
<div class="container">
    <h1 class="mt-4">Bootstrap 5 Grid System</h1>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">Column 1</div> <!-- Occupies 4/12 of the grid -->
        <div class="col-md-4">Column 2</div> <!-- Occupies another 4/12 of the grid -->
        <div class="col-md-4">Column 3</div> <!-- Occupies last 4/12 of the grid -->
    </div>
</div>
```
In this example, we create a container with a title and a row consisting of three columns that will stack on smaller screens but evenly distribute horizontally on medium and larger screens.

### 3. Using Bootstrap Components

Bootstrap 5 comes with a plethora of reusable components that help enhance the user interface of your application. Some of the popular components include buttons, cards, navbars, and modals.

#### Step 3: Adding a Navbar

Hereâ€™s how to create a navigation bar using Bootstrap:

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
  <div class="container">
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Brand</a>
    <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarNav" aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
      <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
    </button>
    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
      <ul class="navbar-nav">
        <li class="nav-item">
          <a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#">Home</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
          <a class="nav-link" href="#">Features</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
          <a class="nav-link" href="#">Pricing</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</nav>
```
This code will create a responsive navigation bar that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. The `navbar-expand-lg` class determines that the navbar should be expanded on large screens and collapsed on smaller devices.
