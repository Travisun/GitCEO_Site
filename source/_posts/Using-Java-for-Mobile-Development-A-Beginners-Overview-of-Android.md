### Introduction to Android Development with Java

In today's digital age, mobile applications have become essential tools for users and businesses alike. With millions of apps available in the Google Play Store, the demand for skilled mobile developers has surged. Java, being one of the most popular programming languages, plays a significant role in the realm of mobile development, particularly for Android applications. Android, developed by Google, is the most widely used mobile operating system globally, and Java is one of its official programming languages, along with Kotlin. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview for beginners looking to leverage Java for Android development.

### 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before diving into coding, the first step is to set up your development environment. To develop Android applications using Java, you need to install the following tools:

#### Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)

1. Download the latest JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
3. Verify the installation by running the following command in your command line:

   ```bash
   java -version  # Check installed Java version
   ```

   This command should return the version of Java installed.

#### Step 2: Install Android Studio

1. Download Android Studio from the [official website](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Install Android Studio following the provided instructions.
3. Open Android Studio and configure it by selecting the default options suggested by the setup wizard.

### 2. Creating Your First Android Application

With your development environment ready, you can now create your first Android app using Java. Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Start a New Project

1. Launch Android Studio and select **"Start a new Android Studio project."**
2. Choose the template for your app. For beginners, the **Empty Activity** template is recommended.
3. Fill in the application name, package name, and specify the location where you want the project to be saved. Choose Java as the programming language.
4. Click **Finish** to create your project.

#### Step 2: Design the User Interface

1. In the project view, navigate to `app > res > layout > activity_main.xml`.
2. Open the XML file to edit the user interface. You can add a simple `TextView` and `Button` as follows:

   ```xml
   <RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
       android:layout_width="match_parent"
       android:layout_height="match_parent">

       <TextView
           android:id="@+id/text_view"
           android:layout_width="wrap_content"
           android:layout_height="wrap_content"
           android:text="Hello, Android!"
           android:layout_centerInParent="true"/>

       <Button
           android:id="@+id/button"
           android:layout_width="wrap_content"
           android:layout_height="wrap_content"
           android:text="Click Me"
           android:layout_below="@id/text_view"
           android:layout_centerHorizontal="true" />
   </RelativeLayout>
   ```

### 3. Coding the Logic in Java

Now it's time to add functionality to the button. To do this, open the `MainActivity.java` file located in `app > java > your.package.name`.

#### Step 1: Accessing UI Components

Add the following code inside the `onCreate` method to access the UI components:

```java
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.Button;
import android.widget.TextView;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private TextView textView;  // Declare a TextView
    private Button button;  // Declare a Button

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); // Set the content view

        // Link the UI elements to their respective Java objects
        textView = findViewById(R.id.text_view);
        button = findViewById(R.id.button);

        // Set an OnClickListener to the button
        button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                textView.setText("Button Clicked!"); // Change the TextView text on button click
            }
        });
    }
}
```

### 4. Running Your Application

Once you have coded the app, it's time to run it:

1. Connect an Android device to your computer or use the built-in emulator.
2. Click on the **Run** button (green triangle) in Android Studio.
3. Choose the device or emulator you want to run the app on and wait for it to launch.
