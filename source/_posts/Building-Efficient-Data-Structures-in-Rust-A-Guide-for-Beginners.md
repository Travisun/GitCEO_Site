# Introduction to Rust and Data Structures

Rust is a modern programming language revered for its performance and safety, especially in systems programming. One of Rust's standout features is its ownership model, which enforces memory safety without a garbage collector. This feature makes Rust particularly suitable for building efficient data structures. In this guide, we will explore various data structures in Rust, offering detailed explanations and code examples to help beginners create optimized solutions for their programming challenges.

## 1. Understanding Data Structures

Data structures are essential for storing and organizing data in a way that enables efficient access and modification. Depending on the requirements of an application, different data structures might provide varying advantages. In Rust, we have several built-in collection types, including:

- **Vectors**: Dynamic arrays that allow for resizing.
- **Hash Maps**: Key-value pairs designed for efficient look-up.
- **Linked Lists**: Collections that use nodes pointing to the next element.

## 2. Working with Vectors

Vectors (`Vec<T>`) are one of the most used data structures in Rust. They offer the ability to grow dynamically and can store any type of data. Here's how to create and manipulate vectors:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Create a new, empty vector of integers
    let mut numbers: Vec<i32> = Vec::new(); // Declare a mutable vector

    // Adding elements to the vector
    numbers.push(1); // Push the value 1 into the vector
    numbers.push(2); // Push the value 2 into the vector
    numbers.push(3); // Push the value 3 into the vector

    // Accessing elements from the vector
    for number in &numbers { // Iterate through the vector by reference
        println!("{}", number); // Print each number
    }
}
```
In this example, we create and manipulate a vector of integers. We leverage the `.push()` method to add elements and a `for` loop to print all numbers.

## 3. Hash Maps: Storing Key-Value Pairs

Hash maps are a versatile collection type that allows you to associate keys with values. They are useful for scenarios where quick look-up is necessary. Hereâ€™s an example of creating and using a hash map in Rust:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    // Create a new hash map
    let mut scores: HashMap<String, i32> = HashMap::new();

    // Insert key-value pairs into the hash map
    scores.insert(String::from("Alice"), 50); // key: "Alice", value: 50
    scores.insert(String::from("Bob"), 40);   // key: "Bob", value: 40

    // Accessing values by keys
    let alice_score = scores.get("Alice").unwrap(); // Get Alice's score
    println!("Alice's score: {}", alice_score); // Print Alice's score
}
```
In this snippet, we utilize the `HashMap` from Rust's standard library. We insert scores for users and retrieve them using the `get()` method, demonstrating how to work effectively with key-value associations.

## 4. Implementing a Linked List

Although Rust's standard library does not include a linked list, you can implement one yourself to understand how pointers work in Rust. Below is a simple implementation of a singly linked list:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>, // Use Box to allocate memory on the heap
}

struct LinkedList {
    head: Option<Box<Node>>, // Head of the list
}

impl LinkedList {
    // Initialize a new linked list
    fn new() -> Self {
        LinkedList { head: None }
    }

    // Add a new value to the front of the list
    fn push(&mut self, value: i32) {
        let new_node = Box::new(Node {
            value,
            next: self.head.take(), // Take previous head as next node
        });
        self.head = Some(new_node); // Update the head to the new node
    }

    // Display all values in the list
    fn display(&self) {
        let mut current = &self.head; 
        while let Some(node) = current { // Iterate through nodes
            print!("{} ", node.value); // Print node's value
            current = &node.next; // Move to the next node
        }
        println!(); // New line after displaying all values
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut list = LinkedList::new(); // Create a new linked list
    list.push(1); // Add values to the list
    list.push(2);
    list.push(3);
    list.display(); // Print all values in the list
}
```
In this example, we create a simple linked list structure where each node points to the next. We use `Option<Box<Node>>` to enable safe ownership and memory management.
