### Introduction to Command Prompt (CMD)

The Command Prompt, commonly referred to as CMD, is a command-line interpreter that is built into the Windows operating system. It allows users to execute commands to perform various tasks, such as file management, network configuration, and system diagnostics. While the graphical user interface (GUI) provides a user-friendly way to interact with the system, CMD offers a powerful alternative for those who prefer text-based commands. Understanding CMD commands is essential for anyone looking to delve deeper into system management and troubleshooting.

### 1. Navigating the File System

#### 1.1 `cd` (Change Directory)

The `cd` command allows you to change the current directory. It helps you navigate through the folder structure of your computer.

```cmd
cd \path\to\your\directory
```
* Example: `cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents` changes the current directory to the Documents folder.

#### 1.2 `dir` (Directory)

The `dir` command lists all files and directories in the current folder. It provides a quick overview of the contents of the directory you are currently in.

```cmd
dir
```
* This command will display a list of all files and folders in the current directory.

### 2. File Management Commands

#### 2.1 `copy`

The `copy` command is used to copy files from one location to another.

```cmd
copy source_file.txt destination_folder\
```
* Example: `copy C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\example.txt D:\Backups\` will copy the `example.txt` file to the `Backups` folder on the D drive.

#### 2.2 `move`

The `move` command is similar to `copy`, but it moves files instead of duplicating them.

```cmd
move source_file.txt destination_folder\
```
* Example: `move C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\example.txt D:\Archive\` moves `example.txt` to the `Archive` folder.

#### 2.3 `del` (Delete)

The `del` command allows you to delete files from your system.

```cmd
del file_to_delete.txt
```
* Example: `del C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\unwanted_file.txt` deletes the specified file.

### 3. System Information and Management

#### 3.1 `ipconfig`

The `ipconfig` command provides detailed information about the network configuration of your computer, including IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.

```cmd
ipconfig
```
* Simply typing `ipconfig` will display the network configuration summary.

#### 3.2 `tasklist`

The `tasklist` command displays a list of all currently running processes and applications.

```cmd
tasklist
```
* This command offers a snapshot of all processes, with their Process ID (PID) and memory usage.

### 4. Network Commands

#### 4.1 `ping`

The `ping` command tests the reachability of a host on a network and measures the round-trip time it takes for messages sent from your computer to reach the destination.

```cmd
ping google.com
```
* This command will send packets to Google's server to check connectivity.

#### 4.2 `tracert`

The `tracert` command is used to trace the route packets take to a network destination, showing all the intermediate devices that handle the data.

```cmd
tracert google.com
```
* This command will display each hop along the route to Google.
