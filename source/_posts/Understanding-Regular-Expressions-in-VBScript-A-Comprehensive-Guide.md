## Introduction to Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (Regex) are a powerful tool used for string pattern matching and manipulation. In the context of VBScript, regular expressions allow you to find, extract, and replace text within strings based on specific patterns. This ability is essential for tasks such as data validation, parsing strings, and more. With VBScript being widely used for web server scripting and automation tasks, understanding regex can significantly enhance your scripting capabilities and efficiency.

## 1. Getting Started with Regular Expressions in VBScript

To use regular expressions in VBScript, you must first create an instance of the `RegExp` object. This object is provided by the Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions library, which you can leverage to perform various regex operations.

### Step 1: Creating a RegExp Object

```vbscript
Dim regex
Set regex = New RegExp ' Creates a new instance of the RegExp object
```

### Step 2: Setting Properties
The `RegExp` object has several properties that you can configure:

- **Pattern**: The regular expression pattern you want to match.
- **Global**: A boolean value that specifies whether to search globally (throughout the entire string).
- **IgnoreCase**: A boolean value that indicates whether to ignore case sensitivity in the match.

Here is an example of setting these properties:

```vbscript
regex.Pattern = "^\d{5}$" ' Matches a 5-digit number
regex.Global = True ' Enables global matching
regex.IgnoreCase = True ' Case-insensitive matching
```

## 2. Using Methods of RegExp Object

The `RegExp` object provides several methods to work with strings efficiently.

### 2.1 Test Method

The `Test` method checks if a string matches the regex pattern:

```vbscript
Dim testString
testString = "12345"

If regex.Test(testString) Then
    WScript.Echo "The string matches the pattern."
Else
    WScript.Echo "The string does not match the pattern."
End If
```
In this example, if `testString` is a 5-digit number, it will print a matching message.

### 2.2 Execute Method

The `Execute` method returns a collection of matches from a string based on the specified pattern. Here is how you can use it:

```vbscript
Dim matches
Set matches = regex.Execute("Contact: 12345, 67890")

For Each match In matches
    WScript.Echo "Found match: " & match.Value ' Output the found match
Next
```

## 3. Common Regular Expressions Patterns

Understanding common regex patterns is crucial for effective pattern matching. Below are some examples:

- **Digit**: `\d` - Matches any single digit.
- **Word character**: `\w` - Matches any letter, digit, or underscore.
- **Whitespace**: `\s` - Matches any whitespace character (e.g., space, tab).
- **Start of string**: `^` - Asserts the start of a string.
- **End of string**: `$` - Asserts the end of a string.
- **Any character**: `.` - Matches any single character except newline.

## 4. Practical Applications of Regular Expressions in VBScript

### 4.1 Email Validation

You can use regex to validate email formats:

```vbscript
regex.Pattern = "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
If regex.Test("example@example.com") Then
    WScript.Echo "Valid email format."
Else
    WScript.Echo "Invalid email format."
End If
```

### 4.2 Phone Number Formatting

You can extract and format phone numbers from a given string:

```vbscript
regex.Pattern = "\b(\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4})\b" ' Matches phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX
Set matches = regex.Execute("Call me at 123-456-7890 or 987-654-3210.")

For Each match In matches
    WScript.Echo "Found phone number: " & match.Value ' Output the found phone number
Next
```

## Summary

Regular expressions are an essential component of VBScript, allowing developers to perform advanced string manipulations and validations. By mastering regex, you can validate input data, extract useful information, and improve data integrity. This guide has provided a comprehensive overview of using regular expressions in VBScript, from creating a `RegExp` object to applying various methods and patterns. Regular expressions can seem complex at first, but with practice, they will become an invaluable tool in your scripting toolkit.
