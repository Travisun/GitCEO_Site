### Introduction to PowerShell GUI Applications

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and automation framework designed primarily for system administrators. One of its lesser-known capabilities is the ability to create graphical user interface (GUI) applications. This tutorial will introduce you to the basics of building GUI applications using PowerShell by leveraging Windows Forms. GUI applications provide a more user-friendly interaction model than typical command-line interfaces, making your scripts accessible to non-technical users.

### Understanding Windows Forms

Windows Forms is a UI framework that provides a platform for designing and implementing GUI applications on the Windows operating system. It offers a set of classes for creating rich desktop applications, allowing developers to easily integrate common UI controls like buttons, labels, text boxes, and more. PowerShell can access these Windows Forms using the .NET Framework, making it possible to design interactive applications through scripting.

### Step 1: Setting Up PowerShell for GUI Development

Before diving into developing your first GUI application, ensure you have the following:

1. Windows Operating System (preferably Windows 10 or later).
2. PowerShell (version 5.0 or later).
3. Basic understanding of PowerShell scripting.

To start, open PowerShell ISE or your preferred PowerShell script editor.

### Step 2: Creating a Basic GUI Application

Now that everything is set up, let’s create a simple form that allows users to input their names and display a greeting. Follow these steps:

#### 2.1 Initialize the Form

Begin by creating the main form object and setting its properties:

```powershell
# Load the necessary assembly for Windows Forms
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms

# Create the form object
$form = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.Form

# Set form properties
$form.Text = "Welcome Application"  # Title of the form
$form.Size = New-Object System.Drawing.Size(300,200)  # Size of the form
$form.StartPosition = "CenterScreen"  # Center the form on the screen
```

#### 2.2 Adding Controls to the Form

Next, you can add various controls to your form. In this case, we will add a label, text box, and button.

```powershell
# Create a label to instruct the user
$label = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.Label
$label.Text = "Enter your name:"
$label.Location = New-Object System.Drawing.Point(10,20)  # Position of the label
$form.Controls.Add($label)  # Add label to the form

# Create a text box for user input
$textBox = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.TextBox
$textBox.Location = New-Object System.Drawing.Point(10,50)  # Position of the text box
$form.Controls.Add($textBox)  # Add text box to the form

# Create a button that will perform an action
$button = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.Button
$button.Text = "Greet Me"
$button.Location = New-Object System.Drawing.Point(10,90)  # Position of the button
$form.Controls.Add($button)  # Add button to the form
```

#### 2.3 Handling Events

Now, let’s add functionality to the button so that it displays a greeting when clicked.

```powershell
# Event handler for button click
$button.Add_Click({
    $name = $textBox.Text  # Get the text from the input box
    [System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox]::Show("Hello, $name!")  # Display greeting
})
```

#### 2.4 Running the Form

Finally, you need to run the form and show it to the user:

```powershell
$form.ShowDialog()  # Display the form as a modal dialog
```

### Conclusion
