## Introduction

Creating web applications can be both a challenging and rewarding experience, especially using modern libraries like React. React, developed by Facebook, has gained immense popularity due to its efficient rendering and component-based architecture. In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a simple yet functional To-Do List application using React. This project is tailored for beginners, providing you with practical experience that will strengthen your understanding of React fundamentals. Let's dive in!

## 1. Setting Up the React Environment

Before we begin coding, we need to set up our React environment. You can do this using the Create React App tool, which simplifies the setup process.

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 2: Create a New React App

Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React application:

```bash
npx create-react-app todo-list
```

This command will create a new folder named `todo-list` with all the necessary files and dependencies.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Folder

Once the project is created, navigate into the folder:

```bash
cd todo-list
```

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

Finally, start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will launch your app in a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the default React welcome screen.

## 2. Creating the To-Do List Components

Next, we need to create the components for our To-Do List app. For this application, we will create three main components: `App`, `TodoList`, and `TodoItem`.

### Step 1: Creating the File Structure

In the `src` directory, create a folder called `components`. Inside `components`, we will create our individual component files:

- `TodoList.js`
- `TodoItem.js`

### Step 2: Building the App Component 

Open the `src/App.js` file and modify it as follows:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'; // Import React and useState hook
import TodoList from './components/TodoList'; // Import TodoList component

function App() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]); // Initialize state to hold todos

  // Function to add a new todo item
  const addTodo = (todo) => {
    setTodos([...todos, todo]); // Update state by adding new todo
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>To-Do List App</h1> {/* Application Title */}
      <TodoList todos={todos} addTodo={addTodo} /> {/* Render TodoList */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App; // Export App component
```

## 3. Implementing the TodoList Component

Now, let's define the `TodoList` component in `src/components/TodoList.js`:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'; // Import React and useState
import TodoItem from './TodoItem'; // Import TodoItem component

function TodoList({ todos, addTodo }) {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState(''); // State for input field

  // Function to handle form submission
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault(); // Prevent default form submission
    if (inputValue) {
      addTodo(inputValue); // Add todo if input is not empty
      setInputValue(''); // Clear input field
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> {/* Form for adding todos */}
        <input 
          type="text" 
          value={inputValue} 
          onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)} // Update input state
          placeholder="Add a new todo" 
        />
        <button type="submit">Add Todo</button> {/* Button to submit todo */}
      </form>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo, index) => (
          <TodoItem key={index} content={todo} /> // Render each todo item
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TodoList; // Export TodoList component
```

## 4. Creating the TodoItem Component

Next, we need to create the `TodoItem` component in `src/components/TodoItem.js`:

```javascript
import React from 'react'; // Import React

function TodoItem({ content }) {
  return <li>{content}</li>; // Render the todo item as a list element
}

export default TodoItem; // Export TodoItem component
```

## 5. Styling the Application

To make our app visually appealing, letâ€™s add some basic styles. Open the `src/App.css` file and modify it:

```css
.App {
  max-width: 600px; /* Set maximum width */
  margin: 0 auto; /* Center the application */
  padding: 20px; /* Add padding */
  text-align: center; /* Center align text */
  background-color: #f0f8ff; /* Light background color */
}

form {
  margin-bottom: 20px; /* Add margin below the form */
}

input {
  padding: 10px; /* Add padding to input */
  margin-right: 10px; /* Space between input and button */
}

button {
  padding: 10px; /* Add padding to button */
  background-color: #61dafb; /* React blue color */
  border: none; /* Remove border */
  color: white; /* White text color */
  cursor: pointer; /* Change cursor on hover */
}
```
