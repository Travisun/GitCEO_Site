### Introduction to TypeScript Classes

TypeScript, an extension of JavaScript, introduces static typing and enhanced features to aid in large scale application development. Among those features, classes stand out as fundamental building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). By leveraging classes, developers can create structured and reusable code, facilitating better project organization. This guide provides an in-depth look at TypeScript classes, focusing on essential aspects for beginners who wish to enhance their programming skills.

### 1. What is a Class in TypeScript?

A class in TypeScript is a blueprint for creating objects that encapsulates data and behavior. It allows developers to define properties and methods that describe what an object can do and the data it holds. In TypeScript, declaring a class is simple:

```typescript
class Person {
    name: string; // Property to store the name of the person
    age: number;  // Property to store the age of the person

    // Constructor method to initialize the properties
    constructor(name: string, age: number) {
        this.name = name; // Assign name to the property
        this.age = age;   // Assign age to the property
    }

    // Method to display information about the person
    displayInfo() {
        console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`);
    }
}

// Creating an instance of Person
const john = new Person('John Doe', 30); // Create new Person object
john.displayInfo(); // Call method to display info
```

### 2. The Constructor Method

The constructor is a special method used to initialize objects created from a class. When an instance of a class is created, the constructor initializes properties or performs any setup required. In the example above, the `constructor` accepts two parameters, `name` and `age`, which are used to set the object's properties.

### 3. Inheritance in TypeScript

One of the powerful features of classes is inheritance, which allows one class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another (parent class). This promotes code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. In TypeScript, inheritance can be implemented using the `extends` keyword:

```typescript
class Employee extends Person {
    position: string; // New property for Employee class

    constructor(name: string, age: number, position: string) {
        super(name, age); // Call the parent class constructor
        this.position = position; // Assign position to the property
    }

    displayInfo() {
        super.displayInfo(); // Call the parent class method
        console.log(`Position: ${this.position}`); // Display additional info
    }
}

// Creating an instance of Employee
const jane = new Employee('Jane Smith', 28, 'Software Engineer');
jane.displayInfo(); // Call method to display all info
```

### 4. Access Modifiers

TypeScript provides access modifiers to set the accessibility of class members. The three main access modifiers are `public`, `private`, and `protected`. By default, all members are public.

- **Public**: Members are accessible from anywhere.
- **Private**: Members are accessible only within the class they are declared in.
- **Protected**: Members are accessible in the class and its subclasses.

Here's how to use access modifiers:

```typescript
class Vehicle {
    private brand: string; // Private property

    constructor(brand: string) {
        this.brand = brand; // Initialize brand
    }

    public getBrand() { // Public method to access private property
        return this.brand; // Return the brand
    }
}

const myCar = new Vehicle('Toyota');
console.log(myCar.getBrand()); // Access brand using public method
// console.log(myCar.brand); // This will cause an error due to private access
```

### Conclusion

TypeScript classes provide an excellent way to implement Object-Oriented Programming principles in your applications, offering a structure that enhances code organization and maintainability. By understanding the foundational elements such as classes, constructors, inheritance, and access modifiers, new developers can write more reliable and scalable applications. With practice, these concepts will become second nature, enabling you to leverage TypeScript effectively.
