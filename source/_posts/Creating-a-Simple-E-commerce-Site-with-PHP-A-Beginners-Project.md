## Introduction

In today's digital age, having an online presence is essential for businesses. E-commerce sites allow users to buy and sell products over the internet, and they can be created using various programming languages. PHP is one of the most popular languages for server-side web development due to its simplicity and flexibility. This article serves as a detailed guide for beginners who want to create a simple e-commerce site using PHP, along with MySQL for the database, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a functional e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout.

## 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment

To begin, you will need a local development environment configured with PHP and MySQL. One of the easiest ways to set this up is by using software like XAMPP or WAMP. These packages come with everything you need to run PHP applications on your local machine.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Download XAMPP** from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
2. **Install XAMPP** by following the on-screen instructions.
3. **Start the Apache and MySQL servers** from the XAMPP Control Panel.
4. **Create a new directory** for your project in the `htdocs` folder of your XAMPP installation, e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\ecommerce`.

## 2. Creating the Database

Next, you will need to set up a database to store product information and user accounts.

### Step-by-Step Database Creation

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
2. Click on the **Databases** tab and create a new database named `ecommerce`.
3. Execute the following SQL queries to create the necessary tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  -- User ID
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,           -- User's login name
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL            -- User's password (hashed)
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,   -- Product ID
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,               -- Product name
    description TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- Product description
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,            -- Product price
    image VARCHAR(255) NULL                    -- Product image URL
);
```

## 3. Building the Registration and Login System

### User Registration

Create a PHP file named `register.php` with the following code to allow users to register:

```php
<?php
require 'db.php'; // Include your database connection file

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {
    $username = $_POST['username']; // Get username from form
    $password = password_hash($_POST['password'], PASSWORD_DEFAULT); // Hash the password

    // SQL query to insert new user into the database
    $sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('$username', '$password')";
    if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {
        echo "Registration successful!";
    } else {
        echo "Error: " . mysqli_error($conn);
    }
}
?>

<form method="POST">
    Username: <input type="text" name="username" required>
    Password: <input type="password" name="password" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Register">
</form>
```

### User Login

For user login functionality, create `login.php`:

```php
<?php
require 'db.php'; // Include your database connection file

session_start(); // Start the session

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {
    $username = $_POST['username']; // Get username
    $password = $_POST['password']; // Get password

    // Check if user exists
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username'";
    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);
    
    if ($result) {
        $user = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result); // Fetch user data
        if (password_verify($password, $user['password'])) { // Verify password
            $_SESSION['user'] = $user['id']; // Set session variable
            echo "Login successful!";
        } else {
            echo "Invalid credentials!";
        }
    }
}
?>

<form method="POST">
    Username: <input type="text" name="username" required>
    Password: <input type="password" name="password" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```

## 4. Displaying Products

To display the products available for sale, create a file named `products.php`.

```php
<?php
require 'db.php'; // Include your database connection file

$sql = "SELECT * FROM products"; // Get all products
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);

while ($product = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) { // Loop through products
    echo "<div>";
    echo "<h2>" . $product['name'] . "</h2>"; // Product name
    echo "<p>" . $product['description'] . "</p>"; // Product description
    echo "<p>Price: $" . $product['price'] . "</p>"; // Product price
    echo "<img src='" . $product['image'] . "' alt='" . $product['name'] . "' />"; // Product image
    echo "</div>";
}
?>
```

## 5. Implementing the Shopping Cart

For a simple shopping cart, you can use PHP sessions to store the cart items. Create a `cart.php` page to manage items added to the cart.

```php
<?php
session_start(); // Start the session

if (!isset($_SESSION['cart'])) {
    $_SESSION['cart'] = []; // Initialize cart if it doesn't exist
}

// Add item to cart
if (isset($_GET['add'])) {
    $id = $_GET['add'];
    // Check if item is already in cart
    if (!in_array($id, $_SESSION['cart'])) {
        $_SESSION['cart'][] = $id; // Add to cart
        echo "Item added to cart!";
    }
}

// Display items in cart
foreach ($_SESSION['cart'] as $item) {
    echo "Product ID: $item<br>"; // Display each item in the cart
}
?>
```
