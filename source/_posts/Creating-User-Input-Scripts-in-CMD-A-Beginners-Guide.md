Introduction to CMD User Input Scripts

Command Prompt (CMD) in Windows is a powerful command line tool that allows users to execute commands interactively and automate tasks using scripts. One of the essential features of batch scripting is the ability to accept user input, making scripts dynamic and interactive. This guide is designed for beginners who wish to learn how to create simple user input scripts in CMD. By understanding how to read inputs and act upon them, users can enhance their productivity and automate repetitive tasks conveniently.

1. Understanding Basic Syntax

Before diving into user input scripts, it’s crucial to familiarize ourselves with the basic syntax of batch files. A batch file is essentially a text file with a `.bat` extension that contains a series of commands executed in sequential order. Each command in CMD is performed by entering it in the command line; in a batch file, these commands are written in the same manner. For example:

```cmd
@echo off
echo Hello, World!  REM This command prints "Hello, World!" to the console
pause                REM This command waits for user input before closing
```

In the above example, `@echo off` prevents the display of the command itself, making the output cleaner, while `pause` prompts the user to press any key to continue.

2. Capturing User Input with the 'set' Command

To create interactive scripts, you can use the `set` command to capture user input. This command prompts users for input and stores it in a variable. The syntax for using `set` is straightforward:

```cmd
set /p VariableName=Enter your input here: 
```

Here’s a simple script that demonstrates this:

```cmd
@echo off
set /p name=What is your name?  REM Prompt user for their name
echo Hello, %name%!             REM Greet the user using the captured name
pause
```

In this script, when run, the command line will prompt the user with "What is your name?", and the user's input will be stored in the variable `name`. The next line uses that variable to greet the user.

3. Advanced User Input Techniques

Once you grasp the basics of capturing user input, you can move on to more complex scenarios. For example, you can validate user input by checking if certain criteria are met. Below is an example of a script that does just that:

```cmd
@echo off
set /p age=Please enter your age:  REM Prompt for age input

REM Check if the age is a number
for /f "delims=0123456789" %%a in ("%age%") do (
    echo Invalid input. Please enter a number.
    goto :eof
)

echo You are %age% years old.
pause
```

In this advanced example, we validate that the user input is indeed a numeric value. The `for` command parses the input and returns an error message for non-numeric entries.

4. Creating Full Interactive Scripts

To create a complete interactive script, you might want to add multiple prompts and branches in your script. Below is an example of a basic decision-making script:

```cmd
@echo off
echo Welcome to the Interactive Script!
set /p choice=Would you like to continue? (yes/no): 

if /i "%choice%"=="yes" (
    echo You chose to continue!
    REM Additional commands can go here
) else (
    echo You chose to exit!
)
pause
```

In this script, the `if /i` statement checks the user's input against the string "yes" (case-insensitive). Depending on the choice, different paths will be executed.

5. Enhancing Your Scripts

To make your scripts even more powerful, consider adding loops, error handling, and even file operations. You can use the `goto` command to create loops in your scripts. Here's a simple loop example:

```cmd
@echo off
:menu
echo Select an option:
echo 1. Greet
echo 2. Exit
set /p choice=Your selection: 

if "%choice%"=="1" (
    set /p name=Enter your name: 
    echo Hello, %name%!
    goto menu  REM Return to the menu
) else (
    echo Goodbye!
    exit
)
```

In this example, a simple menu allows the user to choose to be greeted or exit. The `goto` command loops back to the menu, creating a simple interface.

Conclusion

Creating user input scripts in Command Prompt provides an exciting way to automate tasks and enhance the interactivity of your batch files. With the skills gained from this guide, you can create scripts that respond to user inputs and perform actions accordingly. As you grow more comfortable with CMD and batch scripting, feel free to expand your scripts with additional features, such as file manipulation or integrating external commands.
