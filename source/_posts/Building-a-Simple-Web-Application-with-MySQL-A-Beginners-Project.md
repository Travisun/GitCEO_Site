### Introduction

Building web applications is a fundamental skill in today’s tech landscape. One of the most commonly used databases is MySQL, an open-source relational database management system. For beginners, developing a basic web application using MySQL can provide an excellent introduction to backend development, database handling, and web technology as a whole. Throughout this article, we will walk you through creating a simple web application that utilizes MySQL to manage data.

### 1. Setting Up Your Environment

Before we begin writing code, it's essential to set up our development environment. Here are the steps to do that:

1. **Install XAMPP**:
   - XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.
   - Download XAMPP from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Start the XAMPP control panel**:
   - Once installed, open the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.

3. **Create a Database**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
   - Click on "Databases" and create a new database called `simple_web_app`.

### 2. Designing the Database

Next, we will create a table in our database to store user information. Here’s how to do it:

1. Inside `simple_web_app`, click on "SQL" to execute queries.
2. Execute the following SQL command to create a `users` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Auto-incrementing ID for users
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,           -- User's name
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,              -- User's email address
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- Time of registration
);
```

### 3. Creating the Web Application with PHP

Now let's create a simple PHP application that connects to our MySQL database.

1. **Create a new folder** in `C:\xampp\htdocs` called `myapp`.
2. **Create a new file** called `index.php` inside the `myapp` folder and add the following code:

```php
<?php
// Database connection configuration
$servername = "localhost";              // Server name
$username = "root";                      // Default username for XAMPP
$password = "";                          // Default password for XAMPP (leave empty)

// Create a connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, "simple_web_app");

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error); // Error handling
}
echo "Connected successfully";  // Successful connection message

// Close connection
$conn->close(); 
?>
```

3. **Test the application**:
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/myapp/index.php`. You should see "Connected successfully".

### 4. Implementing CRUD Operations

Now that we have a basic setup, let's implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

#### 4.1. Creating a User

To add a user to the database, modify your `index.php` file as follows:

```php
<?php
// Connection code here...

// Insert a new user
$sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com')";
if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "New user created successfully"; // Confirm user creation
} else {
    echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . $conn->error; // Error handling
}

// Close connection
$conn->close(); 
?>
```

#### 4.2. Reading Users

To retrieve and display users, you can add this code:

```php
// Fetch users
$sql = "SELECT id, username, email FROM users"; // SQL query to select data
$result = $conn->query($sql);

if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    // Output data of each row
    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        echo "id: " . $row["id"]. " - Name: " . $row["username"]. " - Email: " . $row["email"]. "<br>"; // Display user details
    }
} else {
    echo "0 results"; // No users found
}
```

#### 4.3. Updating a User

To update user data, you could implement it like this:

```php
// Update user example
$sql = "UPDATE users SET email='new_email@example.com' WHERE username='john_doe'";
if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "User updated successfully"; // Confirmation of update
} else {
    echo "Error updating record: " . $conn->error; // Error handling
}
```

#### 4.4. Deleting a User

Now, to delete a user, you might add the following code:

```php
// Delete user
$sql = "DELETE FROM users WHERE username='john_doe'";
if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "User deleted successfully"; // Confirmation of deletion
} else {
    echo "Error deleting record: " . $conn->error; // Error handling
}
```
