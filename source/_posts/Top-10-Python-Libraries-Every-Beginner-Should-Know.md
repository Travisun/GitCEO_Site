### 1. NumPy

**Overview:**  
NumPy, or Numerical Python, is the foundational library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a plethora of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures.

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install numpy  # Install NumPy using pip
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
import numpy as np  # Import NumPy library

# Create a 1D NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)  # Print the array

# Calculate the mean of the array
mean_value = np.mean(arr)  # Compute mean
print("Mean:", mean_value)  # Print mean
```

### 2. Pandas

**Overview:**  
Pandas is an indispensable library for data manipulation and analysis. It introduces two primary data structures: Series and DataFrame, making it easy to handle structured data.

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install pandas  # Install Pandas using pip
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
import pandas as pd  # Import Pandas library

# Create a simple DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)  # Create DataFrame
print(df)  # Print the DataFrame

# Calculate the average age
average_age = df['Age'].mean()  # Compute average age
print("Average Age:", average_age)  # Print age
```

### 3. Matplotlib

**Overview:**  
Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library that enables users to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install matplotlib  # Install Matplotlib using pip
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Import the pyplot module from Matplotlib

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

plt.plot(x, y)  # Plot data
plt.title("Sample Plot")  # Add title
plt.xlabel("X-axis")  # Label x-axis
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")  # Label y-axis
plt.show()  # Display the plot
```

### 4. Scikit-Learn

**Overview:**  
Scikit-Learn is a powerful library for machine learning. It provides easy-to-use interfaces for various algorithms, including classification, regression, and clustering.

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install scikit-learn  # Install Scikit-Learn using pip
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  # Import LinearRegression

# Sample data
X = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]  # Input features
y = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]  # Output values

model = LinearRegression()  # Create model
model.fit(X, y)  # Fit model to data

predicted = model.predict([[6]])  # Predict value
print("Predicted value at x=6:", predicted)  # Print predicted value
```

### 5. Flask

**Overview:**  
Flask is a lightweight web framework that allows developers to build web applications quickly. It's a micro-framework, meaning it is simple to set up and flexible, ideally suited for small projects.

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install Flask  # Install Flask using pip
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
from flask import Flask  # Import Flask module

app = Flask(__name__)  # Create Flask app

@app.route('/')  # Define route for homepage
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"  # Return message on homepage

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)  # Run the app in debug mode
```

### 6. Requests

**Overview:**  
The Requests library simplifies the process of making HTTP requests. It abstracts the complexities of dealing with URLs and sessions so that developers can focus on coding.

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install requests  # Install Requests using pip
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
import requests  # Import Requests library

response = requests.get('https://api.github.com')  # Make GET request
print(response.status_code)  # Check status code
print(response.json())  # Print JSON response
```

### 7. BeautifulSoup
