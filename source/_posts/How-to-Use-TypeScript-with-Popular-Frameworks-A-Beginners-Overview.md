### Introduction

As web development grows increasingly sophisticated, using tools that enhance productivity and code quality becomes essential. TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, offers strong typing, interfaces, and modern features that improve both development speed and maintainability. In this article, we will explore how to use TypeScript with three of the most popular frameworks: Angular, React, and Vue.js. Each section will include a clear setup guide and code examples, providing beginners with a solid foundation for integrating TypeScript into their projects.

### 1. Setting Up TypeScript with Angular

Angular is one of the most robust frameworks that seamlessly integrates TypeScript. To get started, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Install Angular CLI**
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli  # Install Angular Command Line Interface globally
```

**Step 2: Create a New Angular Project**
```bash
ng new my-angular-app --strict  # Create a new Angular app with strict mode enabled for TypeScript
```

**Step 3: Navigate to Your Project Directory**
```bash
cd my-angular-app  # Change into the newly created project directory
```

**Step 4: Serve the Application**
```bash
ng serve  # Start the development server at http://localhost:4200
```

In Angular, TypeScript enhances code with types, interfaces, and decorators. Below is an example of a simple TypeScript component:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';  // Importing Component decorator

@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello-world',
  template: '<h1>{{ title }}</h1>'  // Template for the component
})
export class HelloWorldComponent {
  title: string;  // Defining a property with a type
  constructor() {
    this.title = 'Hello, World!';  // Initializing the title property
  }
}
```

### 2. Using TypeScript with React

React is another highly popular library that benefits from TypeScript’s static typing. Here’s how to set it up:

**Step 1: Create a New React App Using Create React App**
```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app --template typescript  # Create a React app with TypeScript template
```

**Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory**
```bash
cd my-react-app  # Change into the project directory
```

**Step 3: Start the Development Server**
```bash
npm start  # Run the application in development mode
```

Below is a simple TypeScript functional component in React:

```typescript
import React from 'react';  // Importing React
import './App.css';  // Importing CSS for styling

const App: React.FC = () => {  // Defining a functional component with React.FC type
  const message: string = 'Hello, TypeScript with React!';  // Type annotation for a variable

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>{message}</h1>  {/* Rendering the message */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;  // Exporting the component
```

### 3. Integrating TypeScript with Vue.js

Vue.js has increasingly embraced TypeScript support, allowing for type-checking and improved developer experiences. To get started:

**Step 1: Create a New Vue Project**
```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli  # Install the Vue CLI globally
vue create my-vue-app  # Create a new Vue project
# During the setup, select the option to use TypeScript
```

**Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory**
```bash
cd my-vue-app  # Change into the project directory
```

**Step 3: Serve the Application**
```bash
npm run serve  # Start the Vue development server
```

Here’s a simple Vue component written in TypeScript:

```typescript
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>  <!-- Displaying the title -->
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from 'vue';  // Importing defineComponent from Vue

export default defineComponent({
  data() {
    return {
      title: 'Hello, TypeScript with Vue!'  // Defining a reactive property
    };
  }
});
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Add component-specific styles here */
</style>
```

### Conclusion

In this article, we have outlined how to use TypeScript with popular web frameworks: Angular, React, and Vue.js. By setting up TypeScript in your projects, you gain access to powerful type-checking features that enhance your development experience. Whether you are building complex applications or simple websites, TypeScript can significantly improve your code quality. 

Feel free to experiment with the provided code snippets and integrate TypeScript into your projects. As you become more comfortable, consider exploring advanced TypeScript features like generics, mixins, and decorators to further enhance your applications.
