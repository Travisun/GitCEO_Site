### Introduction to Verilog
Verilog is a widely-used hardware description language (HDL) that provides a way to model electronic systems. It is primarily utilized in the design and verification of digital circuits. As technology advances, the complexity of designs also increases, necessitating a deeper understanding of advanced features in Verilog. This guide will provide you with an overview of these advanced features and practical examples to enhance your digital design capabilities.

### 1. Understanding Parameterized Modules
Parameterized modules enable designers to create flexible and reusable code. By defining parameters, users can customize module behavior without changing the source code. This section will clarify the concept of parameterized modules using the following example:

```verilog
module param_counter #(parameter N = 8) (          // Define a parameter for width N
    input clk,                                     // Clock input
    input reset,                                   // Asynchronous reset input
    output reg [N-1:0] count                      // Output count using parameterized width
);
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) 
            count <= 0;                           // Reset count to 0
        else 
            count <= count + 1;                   // Increment count on clock edge
    end
endmodule
```
In this example, the `param_counter` module can be instantiated with different values for `N`, allowing for counters of various widths without modifying the core implementation.

### 2. Implementing Finite State Machines (FSM)
Finite State Machines (FSMs) are crucial for modeling the behavior of digital systems with distinct states. This section will guide you through the implementation of a basic FSM in Verilog using a synchronous design pattern:

```verilog
module fsm_example (
    input clk,                                     // Clock input
    input reset,                                   // Asynchronous reset input
    input start,                                   // Input signal to start FSM
    output reg done                                // Output signal indicating completion
);
    typedef enum reg [1:0] {S0, S1, S2} state_t;  // Define states using enumerated type
    state_t current_state, next_state;            // Declare states

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            current_state <= S0;                   // Reset to initial state
        else 
            current_state <= next_state;           // Transition to next state
    end

    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            S0: if (start) next_state = S1; else next_state = S0;  // Transition logic
            S1: next_state = S2;                              // Move to state S2
            S2: next_state = S0;                              // Return to state S0
            default: next_state = S0;                         // Default case
        endcase
    end

    always @(current_state) begin
        done = (current_state == S2);                       // Set done signal when in state S2
    end
endmodule
```
This FSM example demonstrates state transitions based on the input signals. It uses enumerated types for clarity and structured logic.

### 3. Assertions in Verilog
Assertions are powerful tools for verifying that the design adheres to specified properties during simulation. This section introduces assertion statements in Verilog using the SystemVerilog language extension:

```verilog
module counter_with_assertion (
    input clk,                                        // Clock input
    input reset,                                      // Asynchronous reset input
    input [3:0] count                                  // Count input
);
    // Assertion to ensure count never exceeds maximum value
    initial begin
        assert (count <= 15) else $fatal("Count exceeds maximum limit!"); // Check count range
    end
endmodule
```
This snippet demonstrates how you can proactively catch errors by asserting that the count does not exceed specified limits. Assertions enhance robustness and help catch design flaws early in the development process.
