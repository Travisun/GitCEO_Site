### Introduction to Control Flow in C

Control flow refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated in a program. In the C programming language, control flow is often managed using conditional statements such as if statements and looping constructs like for and while loops. Understanding how to control the flow of execution in your programs is paramount to building efficient and effective applications. This article will provide a detailed exploration of if statements and loops in C, complete with examples and explanations for each concept.

### 1. If Statements in C

If statements allow you to execute a block of code conditionally. The syntax for an if statement is as follows:

```c
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
}
```

#### 1.1 Basic If Statement

Here is a simple example to demonstrate an if statement:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number = 10; // Declare an integer variable

    // Check if the number is greater than 5
    if (number > 5) {
        printf("Number is greater than 5\n"); // Output if condition is true
    }

    return 0; // Indicate successful completion of program
}
```

In this example, the program checks if the variable `number` is greater than 5. Since it is, the message is printed to the console.

#### 1.2 Else and Else If Statements

You can extend your if statements with `else` and `else if` to handle multiple conditions:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number = 10;

    if (number > 15) {
        printf("Number is greater than 15\n");
    } else if (number > 5) {
        printf("Number is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 15\n");
    } else {
        printf("Number is 5 or less\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This example will print "Number is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 15" since `number` is 10.

#### 1.3 Nested If Statements

You can nest if statements to evaluate multiple conditions:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number = 10;

    if (number > 5) {
        printf("Number is greater than 5\n");
        if (number > 8) {
            printf("Number is also greater than 8\n");
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this case, the second condition checks if `number` is greater than 8 after confirming it is greater than 5.

#### 1.4 Switch Statement

Another way to control flow is through the `switch` statement, particularly useful for situations with multiple potential conditions:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number = 2;

    switch (number) {
        case 1:
            printf("Number is 1\n");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("Number is 2\n");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Number is neither 1 nor 2\n");
            break;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Here, the program evaluates the value of `number` and prints the corresponding message for case 2.

### 2. Loops in C

Loops allow code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition, increasing efficiency when executing repetitive tasks. C provides several types of loops including `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

#### 2.1 The For Loop

The `for` loop is useful when you know how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        printf("Iteration %d\n", i); // Print each iteration
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the loop will execute five times, outputting the iteration number on each pass.

#### 2.2 The While Loop

The `while` loop runs as long as a specified condition is true:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int count = 1;

    while (count <= 5) {
        printf("Count is %d\n", count); // Output current count
        count++; // Increment count
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Here, `count` is incremented in each iteration until it exceeds 5, terminating the loop.

#### 2.3 The Do-While Loop

The `do-while` loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block will execute at least once:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int count = 1;

    do {
        printf("Count is %d\n", count); // Output current count
        count++; // Increment count
    } while (count <= 5);

    return 0;
}
```

In this case, the loop body executes first, ensuring that the message is printed at least once before the condition is checked.

### Conclusion

Understanding control flow in C programming through if statements and loops is vital for creating functional and efficient programs. This tutorial provided a comprehensive overview of these concepts, including conditional execution with if statements and repetitive execution with loops. By mastering these constructs, you can build applications that respond intelligently to user input and complete tasks efficiently.
