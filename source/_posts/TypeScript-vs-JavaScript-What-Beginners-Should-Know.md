### Introduction

In the world of web development, JavaScript has long been the reigning champion, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive applications. However, with the introduction of TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft, the landscape has evolved. This article aims to compare TypeScript and JavaScript, discussing what beginners should know to make an informed decision on which language to learn or how to approach them both effectively.

### 1. Understanding JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that was initially developed to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, allowing developers to implement complex features on web pages. JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means it runs directly in the browser without the need for compilation.

#### Key Features of JavaScript:
- **Dynamically Typed**: Variables can hold values of any type without declaration of type.
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions in JavaScript are objects, allowing them to be manipulated like any other object.
- **Event-Driven**: JavaScript is designed to respond to user actions, making it ideal for interactive applications.

### 2. Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript builds on JavaScript by adding static typing and other features aimed at improving the development process. It compiles down to regular JavaScript, which means it can run anywhere JavaScript runs. This makes TypeScript highly compatible with existing JavaScript code.

#### Key Features of TypeScript:
- **Static Typing**: TypeScript allows developers to define types for variables and function return values, which helps catch errors during development.
- **Enhanced Code Quality**: With type checking, developers can avoid common pitfalls associated with dynamic typing.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: TypeScript provides features like interfaces, enums, and generics, making it suitable for large-scale applications. 

### 3. Type Safety: A Crucial Difference

One of the primary differences between TypeScript and JavaScript is type safety. TypeScript’s static typing helps prevent runtime errors by enforcing type checks at compile time. Let’s look at a simple example to illustrate this concept:

#### JavaScript Example:
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b; // No type checks
}

console.log(add(5, '10')); // Outputs: 510 (unintended behavior)
```

#### TypeScript Example:
```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b; // Type checks enforced
}

// console.log(add(5, '10')); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
```

### 4. Advantages of Learning TypeScript

For beginners, there are many benefits to learning TypeScript alongside JavaScript:

- **Error Reduction**: With TypeScript's type system, beginners can reduce the likelihood of bugs through early detection.
- **Improved Code Readability**: Explicit types make columns of code easier to read and maintain.
- **Growing Popularity**: More frameworks and libraries, such as Angular and React, are adopting TypeScript, making it a valuable skill for developers.

### 5. Practical Steps to Get Started

#### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
Start by installing Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager). Then, install TypeScript globally by running:
```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

#### Step 2: Writing Your First TypeScript File
Create a new file named `app.ts` and write the following code:
```typescript
const greeting: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
console.log(greeting);
```

#### Step 3: Compiling TypeScript to JavaScript
Compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript by running:
```bash
tsc app.ts
```
This will generate a `app.js` file which you can run using Node.js:
```bash
node app.js
```

### Conclusion

Choosing between TypeScript and JavaScript can be challenging for beginners, but understanding the differences and advantages offered by each language can simplify this decision. TypeScript provides an enhanced level of safety and scalability, which is particularly beneficial in modern web development. Learning both languages will equip new developers with the skills needed to work on a wide range of projects, from small applications to large-scale systems.
