### Introduction to REST APIs

A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a set of rules that allows different applications to communicate over the Internet. This architecture is commonly used in web development for building client-server applications. In this tutorial, we will build a simple REST API using C++ and the Pistache framework, which simplifies the process of developing web services. This guide is tailored for beginner developers with a basic understanding of C++.

### 1. Setting Up the Development Environment

Before we start coding, we need to set up our development environment. Follow the steps below:

#### 1.1 Install Required Tools

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. For Windows, you can use MinGW or Visual Studio. On macOS or Linux, you can use `g++`.
- **CMake**: This is a tool for building software. You can download it from [CMake's official website](https://cmake.org/download/).
- **Pistache**: This is a lightweight HTTP and REST framework for C++. You can download it from [Pistache GitHub repository](https://github.com/oktal/pistache).

#### 1.2 Download Pistache

Clone the Pistache repository and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktal/pistache.git
cd pistache
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install # Install the library
```

### 2. Building the Simple REST API

#### 2.1 Create Project Structure

Let's create a new C++ project. You can create a folder named `SimpleRestApi` and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir SimpleRestApi
cd SimpleRestApi
```

Create the following files:

- `main.cpp` - The main source file of the application.
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Defines the build system for CMake.

#### 2.2 Writing the Code

Here is how you can implement a simple REST API that responds with "Hello, World!" when you access the root endpoint:

```cpp
#include <pistache/http.h>
#include <pistache/endpoint.h>
#include <pistache/router.h>

using namespace Pistache;

// Handler function for the root endpoint
class HelloWorldHandler {
public:
    void onRequest(const Rest::Request& request, Http::ResponseWriter response) {
        response.send(Http::Code::Ok, "Hello, World!"); // Send response
    }
};

// Main function
int main() {
    // Initialize an HTTP endpoint
    Http::Endpoint server(Address(Ipv4::any(), Port(9080))); // Port 9080
    auto opts = Http::Endpoint::options().threads(1); // Set number of threads
    server.init(opts); // Initialize server

    // Set up router and routes
    Rest::Router router;
    HelloWorldHandler helloHandler;
    Routes::Get(router, "/", Routes::bind(&HelloWorldHandler::onRequest, &helloHandler));

    server.setHandler(router.handler()); // Set the request handler

    server.serve(); // Start serving requests
    return 0;
}
```

#### 2.3 CMakeLists.txt

Now, edit `CMakeLists.txt` to include Pistache:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8)
project(SimpleRestApi)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)

find_package(Pistache REQUIRED) # Find Pistache package

add_executable(server main.cpp) # Compile main.cpp
target_link_libraries(server Pistache::pistache) # Link Pistache library
```

### 3. Building and Running the API

#### 3.1 Build the Project

Navigate to the project directory and use CMake to build:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### 3.2 Run the API

After successfully building, run the compiled executable with:

```bash
./server # Run the server
```

Your REST API will start and listen on `http://localhost:9080`.

### 4. Testing the API

To test your API, you can use tools like Postman or curl. To test the root endpoint with curl, use:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9080/
```

You should see the response:

```
Hello, World!
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we successfully built a simple REST API using C++ and the Pistache framework. We walked through setting up the development environment, building the project structure, and implementing basic request handling. This foundational knowledge will serve you as you explore more advanced concepts in web development with C++. Keep experimenting with additional features like routing and request handling to deepen your understanding.
