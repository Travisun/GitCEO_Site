### Introduction to Socket Programming
Socket programming is a fundamental concept for network communication, enabling different devices to communicate over the internet or local networks. It allows the transfer of different types of data between a client and a server, which is crucial in building applications like email clients, web servers, and file transfer utilities. This tutorial will introduce you to using sockets in Python for file transfers, allowing you to manage the sending and receiving of files over a network.

### 1. Setting Up the Environment
To start using sockets in Python, ensure you have Python installed on your system. All we need is the built-in `socket` library, which comes with Python. 

You can check if Python is installed by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version  # Check your Python version
```

If Python is installed, you should see the version number. 

### 2. Creating a Socket Server
The first step in file transfers using sockets is to create a server that will listen for incoming connections. Here’s how to implement a simple socket server:

```python
import socket  # Import the socket library

# Function to create a socket server
def create_server(host='127.0.0.1', port=65432):
    # Create a socket object using IPv4 and TCP
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        # Bind the socket to the host and port
        s.bind((host, port))
        s.listen()  # Listen for incoming connections
        print(f"Server listening on {host}:{port}")
        
        conn, addr = s.accept()  # Accept a connection
        with conn:
            print(f"Connected by {addr}")
            with open('received_file.txt', 'wb') as f:  # Open a file in binary write mode
                while True:
                    data = conn.recv(1024)  # Receive data in chunks of 1024 bytes
                    if not data:  # If no data is received, break the loop
                        break
                    f.write(data)  # Write the received data into the file

create_server()  # Run the server
```

This code sets up a basic socket server that listens on `localhost` (127.0.0.1) at port `65432`. When a client connects, it starts receiving data and writes it to a file named `received_file.txt`.

### 3. Creating a Socket Client
Now, let’s create a client that can send a file to the server. Here’s a simple client implementation:

```python
import socket  # Import the socket library
import os  # Import os to handle file operations

# Function to create a socket client
def send_file(filename, host='127.0.0.1', port=65432):
    # Get the size of the file
    filesize = os.path.getsize(filename)

    # Create a socket object
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect((host, port))  # Connect to the server
        print(f"Connected to server at {host}:{port}")

        # Send the filename and size
        s.sendall(f"{filename}\n{filesize}\n".encode())  # Send filename and file size

        with open(filename, 'rb') as f:  # Open the file in binary read mode
            while True:
                bytes_read = f.read(1024)  # Read the file in chunks of 1024 bytes
                if not bytes_read:  # If there are no bytes left, break
                    break
                s.sendall(bytes_read)  # Send the file data to the server

# Example usage
send_file('example.txt')  # Replace 'example.txt' with the file you want to send
```

This code connects to the server and sends a specified file. Make sure that the file you're trying to send exists in the same directory as the script, or provide an absolute path.

### 4. Running the Server and Client
To test the complete solution, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and run the server script. It will start listening for incoming connections.
2. In another terminal, run the client script providing the filename you wish to send.
3. Upon successful execution, the server will receive the file, and you will see it created in the server's directory.

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, you learned how to set up a simple file transfer system using sockets in Python. We covered creating both a server and a client that works together to send and receive files over a network. This foundational knowledge can be built upon to create more complex networked applications. I encourage you to experiment with adjusting the buffer sizes, handling different data types, and implementing error handling to enhance your skills further in socket programming.
