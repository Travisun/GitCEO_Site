### 1. Mouse Events

Mouse events are essential for adding interactivity to your web pages. Here are some common mouse events in jQuery:

- **click**: Fired when an element is clicked.
  
  ```javascript
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#myButton').click(function() {
      alert('Button was clicked!'); // Alert when button is clicked
    });
  });
  ```

- **dblclick**: Fired when an element is double-clicked.

  ```javascript
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#myDiv').dblclick(function() {
      $(this).toggleClass('highlight'); // Toggle highlight class on double click
    });
  });
  ```

- **mouseenter / mouseleave**: Triggered when the mouse enters or leaves an element.

  ```javascript
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#myDiv').mouseenter(function() {
      $(this).css('background-color', 'blue'); // Change background color on mouse enter
    }).mouseleave(function() {
      $(this).css('background-color', ''); // Remove background color on mouse leave
    });
  });
  ```

### 2. Keyboard Events

Keyboard events allow you to capture user interactions through the keyboard. Common keyboard events include:

- **keydown**: Fired when a key is pressed down.

  ```javascript
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $(document).keydown(function(event) {
      console.log('Key pressed: ' + event.key); // Log the key pressed
    });
  });
  ```

- **keyup**: Fired when a key is released.

  ```javascript
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $(document).keyup(function(event) {
      alert('You released: ' + event.key); // Alert the released key
    });
  });
  ```

### 3. Form Events

Form events are crucial for validating and processing user input. Here are a few key form events:

- **submit**: Fired when a form is submitted.

  ```javascript
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#myForm').submit(function(event) {
      event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default form submission
      alert('Form submitted!'); // Alert on form submission
    });
  });
  ```

- **focus / blur**: Triggered when an input field gains or loses focus.

  ```javascript
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#myInput').focus(function() {
      $(this).css('border-color', 'green'); // Change border color on focus
    }).blur(function() {
      $(this).css('border-color', ''); // Reset border color on blur
    });
  });
  ```
