## Introduction to React and Full-Stack Development

In today's web development landscape, React has emerged as one of the most sought-after libraries for building modern, interactive user interfaces. Its component-based architecture promotes reusable code, making it efficient and scalable for developers. Mastering React not only empowers you to create compelling front-end applications but also sets the foundation for full-stack development by integrating it with backend technologies such as Node.js and Express. This tutorial will guide you from understanding the basics of React to building full-stack applications, equipping you with the skills necessary to excel as a developer.

## 1. Setting Up Your React Environment

Before diving into coding, it's crucial to set up your development environment. We will use Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) since they are essential for managing packages and dependencies in JavaScript applications.

1. **Install Node.js**:
   - Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org) and download the latest version suitable for your operating system.
   - Follow the installation instructions specific to your platform.

2. **Verify Installation**:
   After installation, open your terminal (or command prompt) and check if Node.js and npm are installed correctly by running:
   ```bash
   node -v    # This should show the installed version of Node.js
   npm -v     # This should show the installed version of npm
   ```

3. **Create a New React Application**:
   Use `create-react-app`, a boilerplate tool that sets up a new React project with a default configuration.
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app             # Replace 'my-app' with your desired project name
   cd my-app                                # Move into the project directory
   npm start                                # Starts the development server
   ```

## 2. Understanding Core Concepts of React

Before you can build applications with React, you must grasp the following core concepts:

### 2.1 Components and Props

Components are the building blocks of a React application. A component can either be a class component or a functional component. 

```javascript
// Functional Component Example
function Greeting(props) {  // 'props' is used to pass data to the component
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;  // Displays the greeting message
}
```

To use this `Greeting` component:
```javascript
function App() {
  return <Greeting name="World" />;  // Passing the 'name' prop to the Greeting component
}
```

### 2.2 State Management

State is a built-in object that stores property values that belong to a component. 

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  // Declares a state variable 'count'

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>  // Updates 'count' when clicked
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2.3 Lifecycle Methods

Lifecycle methods allow you to run code at specific points in a component's lifecycle. Here’s an example using class components:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Component has mounted");
  }
  
  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log("Component will unmount");
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Hello, React Lifecycle!</div>;
  }
}
```

## 3. Building a Full-Stack Application

Now that you understand React basics, the next step is to create a full-stack application using Express.js as the backend framework.

### 3.1 Setting Up the Backend

First, we’ll create a simple Express backend.

1. **Initialize a new Node.js project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir backend
   cd backend
   npm init -y  # Creates a package.json file
   npm install express cors mongoose  # Installing necessary packages
   ```

2. **Create a simple server**:
   - In the `backend` directory, create an `index.js` file:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const cors = require('cors');
   
   const app = express();
   const port = 5000;

   app.use(cors());  // Enables CORS for your app
   app.use(express.json());  // Parses incoming JSON requests

   app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
     res.json({ message: "Hello from the backend!" });  // Sends a JSON response
   });

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```

3. **Run your backend server**:
   ```bash
   node index.js  // Starts the Express server
   ```

### 3.2 Connecting React with the Backend

To fetch data from the backend in your React application, you'll use the `fetch` API.

1. **Modify your `App.js`**:
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/data')  // Fetching data from the backend
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return <h1>{data.message}</h1>;  // Displays the received message
}
```

## Conclusion
