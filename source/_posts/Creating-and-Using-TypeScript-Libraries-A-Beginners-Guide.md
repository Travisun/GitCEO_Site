## Introduction to TypeScript Libraries

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. One of the most powerful features of TypeScript is its ability to create reusable libraries that can help developers save time and effort. By creating a TypeScript library, you can encapsulate functionality into a single package, making it easier to share and maintain code across different projects. In this guide, we will explore how to create and use TypeScript libraries from scratch, covering everything from setting up your development environment to best practices for documentation and versioning.

## 1. Setting Up Your Environment

Before diving into library creation, it's critical to set up your development environment. You will need Node.js and TypeScript installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm (Node Package Manager), which you will use to manage dependencies.

### Step 2: Install TypeScript

Open your terminal and run the following command to install TypeScript globally:

```bash
npm install -g typescript 
```
This command ensures you can use the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) from anywhere in your terminal.

## 2. Creating Your First TypeScript Library

Now that your environment is ready, let’s create your first TypeScript library.

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Create a new directory for your library and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my-typescript-library
cd my-typescript-library
```

Then, initialize a new npm project:

```bash
npm init -y
```
This command generates a `package.json` file, which manages your project's dependencies and metadata.

### Step 2: Create Library Files

Next, create a `src` directory for your TypeScript files:

```bash
mkdir src
```

Create a new TypeScript file called `index.ts` within the `src` directory:

```typescript
// src/index.ts
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b; // Returns the sum of a and b
}

export function subtract(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a - b; // Returns the difference of a and b
}
```
In this file, we are exporting two simple functions: `add` and `subtract`, each of which takes two numbers as arguments and returns a number.

### Step 3: Configure TypeScript

To use TypeScript, we need to create a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`). Run the following command:

```bash
tsc --init
```

This creates a default `tsconfig.json` file. You may want to modify it to include output options. Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es5", // The target JavaScript version
        "module": "commonjs", // The module system to use
        "outDir": "./dist", // The output folder for compiled files
        "strict": true // Enables strict type-checking options
    },
    "include": [
        "src/**/*" // Specifies the folder(s) to compile
    ]
}
```

### Step 4: Compile Your Library

Now it’s time to compile your TypeScript files. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
tsc
```

This command will compile your TypeScript code into JavaScript and place the output in the `dist` folder as specified in the `tsconfig.json` file.

## 3. Using Your TypeScript Library

### Step 1: Link Your Library Locally

While developing, you might want to test your library in another project. You can use npm's link command:

1. Navigate to your library's directory.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
npm link
```

This command makes your library available globally in your local environment.

### Step 2: Create a Test Project

Next, create another directory for your test project:

```bash
mkdir test-project
cd test-project
npm init -y
```

In your test project, link your library:

```bash
npm link my-typescript-library
```

### Step 3: Use Your Library

You can now use your library in your test project's files. Create a file called `index.ts` in the `test-project` directory:

```typescript
// index.ts
import { add, subtract } from 'my-typescript-library';

console.log(add(5, 3));        // Outputs: 8
console.log(subtract(5, 3));   // Outputs: 2
```

### Step 4: Compile and Run Your Test Project

Since this is also TypeScript, ensure you've configured `tsconfig.json` for this project too. Once set, compile and run your project:

```bash
tsc
node index.js
```

## 4. Best Practices for Documentation and Versioning

### Documentation

Documenting your library is crucial for both users and maintainers. Tools like Typedoc can generate documentation from your TypeScript comments.

You can install Typedoc using:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typedoc
```

Then, you can generate documentation with:

```bash
npx typedoc --out docs src
```

### Versioning

When you publish your library, utilize semantic versioning. Update the version in `package.json` according to the changes made. Use `npm version` command for easier versioning.

## Conclusion

Creating and using TypeScript libraries can significantly improve your productivity and code quality. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can create your own reusable libraries, leverage others' libraries, and contribute to the broader TypeScript community. Make sure to document your work and manage versions effectively for the best results.
