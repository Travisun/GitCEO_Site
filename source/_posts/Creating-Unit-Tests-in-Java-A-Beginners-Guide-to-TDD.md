### Introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD)

In the world of software development, creating robust applications that can easily be maintained and upgraded is crucial. One of the best practices to achieve this is through Test-Driven Development (TDD). TDD is a software development process where tests are written before the actual code. This allows developers to understand what they need to implement, ensuring the code meets its requirements from the get-go. In this guide, we will explore how to create unit tests in Java using TDD, primarily focusing on leveraging JUnit and Mockito as our testing frameworks.

### Understanding Unit Tests

Unit tests are automated tests that verify individual components or methods of your software. They help catch bugs early and serve as documentation for how the code is supposed to behave. By following TDD principles, we can ensure that our code is thoroughly tested and behaves as expected. The unit tests are written first, and then we incrementally develop the code until the tests pass.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before we start writing unit tests, we need to set up our development environment correctly. Ideally, you'll need:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK installed. You can download it from the official Oracle website or OpenJDK.
2. **Maven or Gradle**: We will use Maven for this guide. Install it if it’s not present.
3. **JUnit**: JUnit is the most popular testing framework for Java. It can be easily added as a dependency in your `pom.xml` file as follows:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.13.2</version> <!-- Check for the latest version -->
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

4. **Mockito**: Mockito is a mocking framework that helps you create and configure mock objects. Similarly, add it to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
    <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
    <version>4.3.1</version> <!-- Check for the latest version -->
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Writing Your First Test

Now that we have the setup, let’s write our first unit test using JUnit. We'll start with a simple example of a calculator.

1. **Create a Calculator Class**:

```java
public class Calculator {
    // Method to add two numbers
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b; // Return sum of a and b
    }
}
```

2. **Create a Test Class**:

In the `src/test/java` directory, create a test class named `CalculatorTest`:

```java
import org.junit.Test; // Import JUnit test annotation
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals; // Import assertion methods

public class CalculatorTest {
    
    @Test // Annotation to denote this is a test method
    public void testAdd() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator(); // Create instance of Calculator
        assertEquals(5, calculator.add(2, 3)); // Assert that 2 + 3 = 5
    }
}
```

### Running Your Tests

You can run your tests using Maven from the terminal. Navigate to your project root directory and use the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your test passing.

### Mocking Dependencies with Mockito

As applications evolve, methods often interface with external dependencies, such as databases or web services. Using Mockito, you can create mock objects to simulate these dependencies.

1. **Create a Service Class**:

```java
public class UserService {
    private UserRepository userRepository; // Assume UserRepository is an interface to interact with the database

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository; // Constructor injection
    }

    public User getUserById(int id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id); // Call to the repository
    }
}
```

2. **Create a Mock Test**:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*; // Import Mockito methods
import org.junit.Test;

public class UserServiceTest {

    @Test
    public void testGetUserById() {
        UserRepository mockRepository = mock(UserRepository.class); // Create a mock instance of UserRepository
        User user = new User("John Doe"); // Create a new User object

        when(mockRepository.findById(1)).thenReturn(user); // Stub the repository method to return the user

        UserService userService = new UserService(mockRepository); // Pass mock repository to the service
        assertEquals("John Doe", userService.getUserById(1).getName()); // Assert expected result
    }
}
```

### Best Practices in Unit Testing

- **Keep Tests Independent**: Each test should be independent from others to avoid side effects.
- **Use Meaningful Names**: Naming your tests clearly reflects what the tests do, making the reports easier to understand.
- **Run Tests Frequently**: Make it a habit to run your tests regularly during development to catch issues early.

### Conclusion

Unit testing is a vital aspect of software development that ensures reliability and maintainability of your code. By employing Test-Driven Development, you can boost your confidence in writing quality code that meets its requirements. Through JUnit and Mockito, you have powerful tools at your disposal to create effective unit tests. Incorporate these practices into your development workflow, and you'll see significant improvements in your code quality and efficiency.
