### Introduction to Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are sequences of characters that form a search pattern, primarily used for string searching and manipulation. They are powerful tools in programming and can be applied in various languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Java. Combining multiple regex patterns is particularly helpful when dealing with complex text searches that require extracting or validating information from strings effectively. This guide aims to help beginners understand how to combine different regex patterns through detailed explanations and examples.

### 1. Understanding the Basics of Regular Expressions

Before we delve into combining regex patterns, it's essential to grasp the basics of regular expressions. The fundamental building blocks of regex include:

- **Literals**: Characters that match themselves (e.g., `a`, `b`, `1`).
- **Metacharacters**: Special characters that have specific meanings (e.g., `.` matches any character, `*` matches zero or more of the preceding character).
- **Character Classes**: Defined set of characters (e.g., `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter).
- **Anchors**: Positions in a string (e.g., `^` asserts position at the start, `$` asserts position at the end of a line).

### 2. Combining Patterns Using Alternation

One of the simplest ways to combine regex patterns is through **alternation**. This allows you to specify multiple options for matching. For instance, if you want to match either "cat" or "dog", you can use the following regex pattern:

```regex
cat|dog
```

#### Example in Python:
```python
import re

# Test string
text = "I have a cat and a dog."

# Combined regex pattern
pattern = r"cat|dog"  # Matches either 'cat' or 'dog'

# Performing the search
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)  # Find all occurrences
print(matches)  # Output: ['cat', 'dog'] 
```

### 3. Using Grouping for Complex Patterns

**Grouping** is another technique that allows you to combine patterns within parentheses. This can be used for applying quantifiers or capturing specific parts of matches. 

#### Example:
To match email addresses that can either end with `.com` or `.net`, you can use:

```regex
\w+@\w+\.(com|net)
```

#### Example in Python:
```python
import re

# Test string
text = "Contact us at support@example.com or sales@example.net."

# Combined regex pattern with grouping
pattern = r"\w+@\w+\.(com|net)"  # Matches email addresses ending with .com or .net

# Performing the search
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['com', 'net'] 
```

### 4. Advanced Combining with Lookahead and Lookbehind

For more advanced scenarios, **lookaheads** and **lookbehinds** can be used to combine patterns without consuming characters in the search string. A lookahead allows you to check if a certain pattern follows the current position in the string.

#### Lookahead Example:
To match a word only if it is followed by a number:
```regex
\w+(?=\d)
```

### 5. Final Thoughts on Combining Regex Patterns

Combining multiple regex patterns effectively allows you to create powerful search expressions for text processing tasks. By understanding basic concepts like alternation, grouping, and lookaheads, you can maximize the utility of regex in your programming endeavors.

### Conclusion

The ability to combine multiple regular expressions opens up a new realm of possibilities for text parsing and manipulation. As you delve deeper into regex, you'll discover even more techniques and patterns to enhance your skills. Experiment with the examples provided and try creating your own combined patterns to solidify your understanding.
