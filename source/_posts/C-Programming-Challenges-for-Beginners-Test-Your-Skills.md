### Challenge 1: Reverse a String

#### Explanation

Reversing a string is a common challenge that helps beginners understand arrays and string manipulation in C.

#### Steps

1. Declare a character array for the string input.
2. Use a loop to reverse the string.
3. Print the reversed string.

#### Sample Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char str[100]; // Declare a character array for the string
    printf("Enter a string: ");
    fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin); // Read the string input

    int length = strlen(str) - 1; // Get the length of the string
    for (int i = 0; i < length / 2; i++) {
        // Swap characters
        char temp = str[i]; // Temporary variable to hold the character
        str[i] = str[length - i - 1]; // Swap the current character with its corresponding character
        str[length - i - 1] = temp; // Complete the swap
    }

    printf("Reversed string: %s\n", str); // Output the reversed string
    return 0; // Indicate that the program ended successfully
}
```

### Challenge 2: Check if a Number is Prime

#### Explanation

Checking for prime numbers reinforces the concepts of loops and conditionals.

#### Steps

1. Prompt the user to enter a number.
2. Use a loop to determine if the number is prime.
3. Print whether the number is prime or not.

#### Sample Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num, isPrime = 1; // Variable to store the user input and check if it's prime
    printf("Enter a positive integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &num); // Read the integer input

    if (num <= 1) { // Check for numbers less than or equal to 1
        isPrime = 0; // Not prime
    } else {
        for (int i = 2; i <= num / 2; i++) { // Loop to check for factors
            if (num % i == 0) { // If num is divisible by i
                isPrime = 0; // Not prime
                break; // Exit the loop
            }
        }
    }

    if (isPrime)
        printf("%d is a prime number.\n", num); // Output result
    else
        printf("%d is not a prime number.\n", num); // Output result

    return 0; // Successful completion
}
```

### Challenge 3: Fibonacci Series

#### Explanation

Generating a Fibonacci series will help you understand loops and how to manage sequences in arrays.

#### Steps

1. Define the number of terms in the series.
2. Use a loop to generate the series.
3. Print the Fibonacci series.

#### Sample Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n; // Number of terms
    printf("Enter the number of terms: ");
    scanf("%d", &n); // Read the number of terms

    int first = 0, second = 1, next; // Initialize the first two terms
    printf("Fibonacci Series: ");

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i <= 1)
            next = i; // First two terms are 0 and 1
        else {
            next = first + second; // Calculate the next term
            first = second; // Update first
            second = next; // Update second
        }
        printf("%d ", next); // Print the current term
    }

    printf("\n");
    return 0; // Indicate that the program ended successfully
}
```
