### Introduction to Sockets

Socket programming is a crucial part of networking, which allows communication between devices over the internet or within a local network. In Java, sockets provide a means to establish connections between clients and servers, enabling data exchange. Understanding sockets is essential for anyone looking to delve into network programming, as they form the backbone of many applications, from simple chat programs to complex web servers.

Java's `java.net` package offers a straightforward API for socket programming, allowing developers to create both client and server applications. This guide will walk you through the basics of using sockets in Java, including detailed steps and code examples to ensure you have a solid understanding of how they work.

### 1. Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start coding, ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html). After installing the JDK, set up your IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) to create and run Java applications.

### 2. Understanding Client-Server Architecture

In socket programming, the client-server architecture is fundamental. The server listens for incoming connections and handles multiple client requests. To establish a connection, the client must know the server's IP address and the port number on which the server is listening.

#### Key Components:
- **Server Socket**: Represents the server side of a socket connection.
- **Client Socket**: Represents the client side of a socket connection.

### 3. Creating a Simple Server

To create a simple server in Java that listens for client connections, follow these steps:

**Step 1**: Import Necessary Packages
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*; // Importing classes for networking
```

**Step 2**: Create the Server Class
```java
public class SimpleServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create a server socket listening on port 12345
            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(12345); 
            System.out.println("Server is listening on port 12345");
            
            // Accept a connection from a client
            Socket socket = serverSocket.accept(); 
            System.out.println("Client connected: " + socket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress());
            
            // Output stream to send data to the client
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true); 
            out.println("Welcome to the server!"); // Send message to client
            
            // Close the resources
            out.close();
            socket.close();
            serverSocket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace(); // Print any exception that occurs
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Creating a Simple Client

Now that we have a server set up, let’s create a simple client to connect to it.

**Step 1**: Import Necessary Packages
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*; // Importing classes for networking
```

**Step 2**: Create the Client Class
```java
public class SimpleClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Connect to the server running on localhost at port 12345
            Socket socket = new Socket("127.0.0.1", 12345); 
            
            // Input stream to receive messages from the server
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())); 
            String message = in.readLine(); // Read the message sent by the server
            System.out.println("Server says: " + message); // Print the server's message
            
            // Close the resources
            in.close();
            socket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace(); // Print any exception that occurs
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Running the Server and Client

To test the server and client:

1. **Compile** the server class:
   ```
   javac SimpleServer.java
   ```

2. **Run** the server:
   ```
   java SimpleServer
   ```

3. **Compile** the client class:
   ```
   javac SimpleClient.java
   ```

4. **Run** the client:
   ```
   java SimpleClient
   ```

### 6. Handling Multiple Clients

For real-world applications, servers often handle multiple clients simultaneously. This can be implemented using threads. You can create a new thread for each incoming client connection. Here’s a simple modification to our server that handles multiple clients using the `Runnable` interface.

```java
public class MultiClientServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(12345);
            System.out.println("Multi-client server started on port 12345");
            while (true) {
                // Accept an incoming connection
                Socket socket = serverSocket.accept(); 
                System.out.println("Client connected: " + socket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress());
                // Start a new thread to handle this client
                new Thread(new ClientHandler(socket)).start(); 
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

class ClientHandler implements Runnable {
    private Socket socket;

    public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {
        this.socket = socket;
    }

    public void run() {
        try {
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
            out.println("Welcome to the multi-client server!");

            // Handling client communication can be added here.

            // Close resources
            out.close();
            socket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
