### 1. Navigation Bar

One of the core components in Bootstrap is the navigation bar (navbar). A well-structured navigation bar is essential for guiding users through your website.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a responsive navbar:

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Brand</a>
  <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNav" aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span> <!-- Burger icon for mobile view -->
  </button>
  <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
    <ul class="navbar-nav">
      <li class="nav-item active">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Home <span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a> <!-- Active link -->
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Features</a> <!-- Link to features -->
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Pricing</a> <!-- Link to pricing -->
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</nav>
```

### 2. Buttons

Buttons are critical UI elements that enable user interactions. Bootstrap provides various classes to style buttons in different contexts.

Here is how you can create different types of buttons:

```html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary Button</button> <!-- Primary button example -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary Button</button> <!-- Secondary button example -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-success">Success Button</button> <!-- Success button example -->
```

### 3. Cards

Bootstrap cards are flexible content containers with multiple variants and options, including headers, footers, images, and more.

To create a card, you can use the following code:

```html
<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <img src="image.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="Image description"> <!-- Card image -->
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card Title</h5> <!-- Card title -->
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title.</p> <!-- Card text -->
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a> <!-- Button within the card -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### 4. Modals

Modals are dialog boxes that can be used to display additional information without navigating away from the current page.

To implement a modal, use the following code snippet:

```html
<!-- Button to trigger modal -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#exampleModal">Launch demo modal</button>

<!-- Modal -->
<div class="modal fade" id="exampleModal" tabindex="-1" aria-labelledby="exampleModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
  <div class="modal-dialog">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <div class="modal-header">
        <h5 class="modal-title" id="exampleModalLabel">Modal title</h5> <!-- Modal title -->
        <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"> <!-- Close button -->
          <span>&times;</span>
        </button>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        Modal body text goes here. <!-- Modal content -->
      </div>
      <div class="modal-footer">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button> <!-- Close button -->
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Save changes</button> <!-- Save changes button -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 5. Forms

Forms are critical for gathering user inputs. Bootstrap provides various classes to create stylish and responsive forms.

Here's an example of a Bootstrap form:

```html
<form>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="exampleInputEmail1">Email address</label> <!-- Email label -->
    <input type="email" class="form-control" id="exampleInputEmail1" aria-describedby="emailHelp"> <!-- Email input -->
    <small id="emailHelp" class="form-text text-muted">We'll never share your email with anyone else.</small> <!-- Email help text -->
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="exampleInputPassword1">Password</label> <!-- Password label -->
    <input type="password" class="form-control" id="exampleInputPassword1"> <!-- Password input -->
  </div>
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button> <!-- Submit button -->
</form>
```
