## 1. Navigating the File System

CMD allows you to navigate through your computer's directory structure using simple commands. Here are the key commands for navigation:

### 1.1 Changing Directories

To change directories, use the following command:

```
cd C:\Path\To\Your\Folder
```
- `cd` stands for "change directory."
- Replace `C:\Path\To\Your\Folder` with the actual path to the desired directory.

### 1.2 Viewing the Current Directory

To see the current directory you're in, simply type:

```
cd
```

### 1.3 Listing Files and Folders

To list all files and directories within the current directory, use the `dir` command:

```
dir
```
- This will output a list of files and folders, including details like size and last modified date.

## 2. File Operations

CMD is also useful for managing files. Here are common file operations:

### 2.1 Creating a New Directory

To create a new directory, use:

```
mkdir NewFolder
```
- `mkdir` stands for "make directory," and `NewFolder` is the name of the new directory.

### 2.2 Copying Files

To copy files from one location to another, use:

```
copy C:\Source\file.txt D:\Destination\
```
- Replace `C:\Source\file.txt` with the source file path and `D:\Destination\` with your desired destination.

### 2.3 Deleting Files

To delete a file, use:

```
del C:\Path\To\Your\File.txt
```
- The `del` command will permanently delete the specified file.

## 3. Running Programs and Scripts

CMD can be used to execute programs and scripts, enhancing productivity:

### 3.1 Running Executables

To run an executable file, simply type its path:

```
C:\Path\To\Your\Program.exe
```

### 3.2 Running Batch Scripts

Batch scripts can automate repetitive tasks. To run a batch file:

```
C:\Path\To\Your\Script.bat
```

## 4. System Information and Network Commands

CMD can provide valuable system information and assist in network configurations:

### 4.1 Displaying System Information

Use the following command to view system information:

```
systeminfo
```

### 4.2 Network Configuration

To view your computer's IP configuration, use:

```
ipconfig
```

## 5. Creating Shortcuts with Aliases

You can create aliases (or shortcuts) for frequently used commands to save time:

```
doskey ls=dir
```
- This creates an alias `ls` that executes the `dir` command.
