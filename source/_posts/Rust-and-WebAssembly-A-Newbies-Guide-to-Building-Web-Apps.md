**Introduction to Rust and WebAssembly**

Rust is a systems programming language known for its performance, memory safety, and concurrency. With the rise of web development demands, Rust has found its way into the browser through WebAssembly (Wasm), a binary instruction format that allows running high-level languages like Rust on the web. This combination enables developers to create fast and efficient web applications that can leverage Rust's capabilities. In this guide, we will explore how to set up your environment and build a simple web app using Rust and WebAssembly, paving the way for further learning in this exciting area.

**1. Setting Up Your Development Environment**

Before we dive into coding, we need the right tools. Here’s how to prepare your environment for working with Rust and WebAssembly:

1. **Install Rust:**
   First, you need to install Rust on your machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

   This command downloads and installs `rustup`, Rust’s official installer and version management tool. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

2. **Add the WebAssembly target:**
   After installing Rust, you need to add the WebAssembly target using the following command:

   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

   This command tells Rust to compile your code to the WebAssembly format.

3. **Install `wasm-pack`:**
   `wasm-pack` is a tool that helps you build Rust-generated WebAssembly packages. Install it with:

   ```bash
   cargo install wasm-pack
   ```

4. **Setting Up a New Project:**
   Create a new Rust project by running:

   ```bash
   cargo new rust_wasm_app --lib
   ```

   After this, navigate to the newly created project directory:

   ```bash
   cd rust_wasm_app
   ```

5. **Update Your `Cargo.toml`:**
   Open the `Cargo.toml` file in your project directory and add the following dependencies to enable WebAssembly features:

   ```toml
   [lib]
   crate-type = ["cdylib"] 

   [dependencies]
   wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
   ```

   The `wasm-bindgen` library is crucial for interfacing between Rust and JavaScript.

**2. Writing Your First Rust Code for WebAssembly**

Now that your environment is ready, it’s time to write some Rust code. Open `src/lib.rs` and replace its contents with the following code:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

// This function will be called from JavaScript
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name) // Returns a greeting message
}
```

In this code, we define a simple function `greet` that takes a name as a parameter and returns a greeting message. The `#[wasm_bindgen]` attribute makes the function accessible from JavaScript.

**3. Compiling Rust to WebAssembly**

To compile your Rust code into WebAssembly, use the following command in your project directory:

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

This command compiles the Rust code into a `.wasm` file and prepares a JavaScript wrapper that allows you to use the Rust functions in your web applications. The generated files will appear in the `pkg` folder.

**4. Creating the HTML and JavaScript Setup**

Now, we’ll create an HTML file to utilize our WebAssembly module. Create a new file named `index.html` in the project root with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Rust and WebAssembly App</title>
    <script type="module">
        import init, { greet } from './pkg/rust_wasm_app.js';

        async function run() {
            await init(); // Initialize the WebAssembly module
            const greeting = greet('World'); // Call the Rust function
            document.getElementById('greeting').innerText = greeting; // Display greeting
        }

        run(); // Execute the run function
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="greeting"></h1> <!-- Placeholder for the greeting message -->
</body>
</html>
```

In this HTML code, we import the compiled JavaScript file from `wasm-pack` and call the `greet` function, passing in "World" as the argument. The greeting message is then displayed on the webpage.

**5. Running Your Web Application**

To view your web application, you can use any simple web server. If you have Python installed, you can quickly set one up using:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

This will start a local server. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`, and you should see the greeting message displayed.

**Conclusion**

In this newbie's guide, you learned how to set up a development environment for Rust and WebAssembly, write your first Rust code that can be called from JavaScript, and display the output in a simple web application. The combination of Rust and WebAssembly opens up exciting opportunities for high-performance web development. By continuing to explore both technologies, you can unlock the full potential of modern web applications.
