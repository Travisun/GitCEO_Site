### 1. Installing Lua on Different Operating Systems

#### 1.1 Windows

To install Lua on Windows, follow these steps:

1. **Download Lua**: Visit the official Lua website at [www.lua.org](http://www.lua.org/download.html) and download the latest binary release for Windows.

2. **Extract the Files**: Use a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the downloaded ZIP file to your preferred location (e.g., `C:\Lua`).

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.
   - Click on 'Advanced system settings' and then 'Environment Variables'.
   - Under 'System variables', find the 'Path' variable and select 'Edit'.
   - Add the path to your Lua directory (e.g., `C:\Lua`) at the end of the list.

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open the Command Prompt (search for `cmd`).
   - Type `lua -v` and press Enter. You should see the version of Lua displayed, indicating that it has been successfully installed.

```batch
:: Command Prompt to check Lua version
lua -v
```

#### 1.2 macOS

To install Lua on macOS, you can use Homebrew, a package manager recommended for macOS users. Here’s how:

1. **Install Homebrew** (if not already installed):
   Open Terminal and paste the following command:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Lua**: Once Homebrew is set up, run the command:

   ```bash
   brew install lua
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - In your Terminal, type `lua -v` to check if Lua was installed correctly.

```bash
# Check if Lua is installed successfully
lua -v
```

#### 1.3 Linux

For Linux users, Lua can typically be installed via your distribution’s package manager. Here's an example using Ubuntu:

1. **Open Terminal**.

2. **Install Lua** by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install lua5.3
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Run `lua -v` in Terminal to confirm the installation.

```bash
# Check Lua version in Ubuntu
lua -v
```

### 2. Writing Your First Lua Script

Once you have installed Lua, it’s time to write your first script! Open a text editor (such as Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS, or nano in Linux) and create a new file called `hello.lua`.

```lua
-- hello.lua
-- This is a simple Lua script that prints "Hello, World!"
print("Hello, World!")  -- Output the greeting to the console
```

To run your script, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `hello.lua` file, and type:

```bash
lua hello.lua  -- Command to execute your Lua script
```

### 3. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

Sometimes installation may not go as planned. Here are a few common issues and their solutions:

- **Lua Command Not Found**: Ensure that you have added the Lua directory to your system’s Path variable.
- **Missing Libraries**: If you encounter errors while running scripts, make sure you have all necessary libraries installed. Refer to the Lua documentation for any additional dependencies.
- **Permissions Issues**: On Linux or macOS, you might need to prepend `sudo` to your installation commands to gain the necessary permissions.

### Conclusion

Setting up Lua on your system is quite straightforward, whether you are using Windows, macOS, or Linux. With this guide, you should now have Lua installed, and you should be able to write and run your first script successfully. Lua is a versatile programming language that can open doors to various development fields, especially in game programming and embedded systems. As you continue your journey with Lua, don't forget to explore its documentation, resources, and vibrant community to deepen your understanding and enhance your skills.
