### Introduction to C++ Classes

C++ is a versatile programming language that supports various programming paradigms, including procedural, generic, and object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP is one of the key features of C++ that enables developers to model real-world entities and create reusable code. This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first C++ class. We will cover the key concepts behind classes and objects, and provide detailed steps and code examples to ensure you have a solid understanding of this fundamental aspect of C++ programming.

### 1. What is a Class in C++?

A class in C++ is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (member functions) that describe the behavior and qualities of the objects. By using classes, you can group related functionalities and data together, which improves the organization of your code and enhances reusability.

### 2. Defining a Class

To define a class, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a block of code containing its members. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to define a class representing a `Car`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Define the Car class
class Car {
public:
    // Data members
    std::string brand; // Car brand
    int year;          // Manufacture year

    // Member function to display car details
    void display() {
        std::cout << "Car brand: " << brand << ", Year: " << year << std::endl; // Print car details
    }
};
```

In this example:
- `Car` is the class name.
- It has two public data members: `brand` and `year`.
- The member function `display()` is defined to print the car details to the console.

### 3. Creating Objects

Once you have defined a class, you can create objects (instances of the class) using the following syntax:

```cpp
int main() {
    Car myCar; // Create an object of the Car class

    // Assign values to the data members
    myCar.brand = "Toyota"; // Setting brand
    myCar.year = 2020;      // Setting manufacture year

    // Call the member function
    myCar.display(); // Display the car details

    return 0; // Return statement
}
```

In the code above:
- We create an object `myCar` of type `Car`.
- We assign the brand and year to the `myCar` object.
- Finally, we call the `display()` function to output the car information.

### 4. Access Modifiers

In C++, there are three access modifiers: `public`, `private`, and `protected`. The `public` keyword allows members to be accessible from outside the class. If you declare a member as `private`, it cannot be accessed from outside the class. This is crucial for encapsulation, which is a core principle of OOP. For example:

```cpp
class Account {
private:
    double balance; // Private member

public:
    void setBalance(double amount) { // Public member function
        balance = amount; // Set balance
    }

    double getBalance() { // Public member function
        return balance; // Get balance
    }
};
```

Here, the `balance` is a private member that cannot be accessed directly from outside the class, ensuring that it can only be modified using the `setBalance()` function.

### 5. Conclusion

In this article, we explored the basics of creating and using classes in C++. You learned how to define a class, create objects, and work with member functions. Understanding classes is essential for mastering object-oriented programming, which is widely used in software development today. As you continue your C++ journey, practice creating different classes and utilize their functionalities to build more complex applications.
