### Introduction

Creating a simple calculator in C is an excellent project for beginners who want to dive into programming using this powerful language. This project will help you understand basic programming concepts such as variables, data types, functions, and control structures, while also enabling you to build a functional application. In this tutorial, we will create a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before diving into the code, ensure you have a C compiler installed. Popular choices include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and Clang. You can install an integrated development environment (IDE) like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio Code to streamline your coding process. 

#### a. Installing GCC on Windows
1. Download the MinGW installer from [mingw-w64.org](https://mingw-w64.org/).
2. Follow the installation instructions and include the `bin` folder in your system's PATH environment variable to enable command line usage.

#### b. Installing GCC on Linux
You can install GCC using your package manager, for instance:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### 2. Writing Your Calculator Code

Now that your environment is set up, you can start coding. Create a new C file named `calculator.c` and open it in your text editor or IDE of choice.

```c
#include <stdio.h> // Include the standard input-output library

// Function prototypes
float add(float a, float b);
float subtract(float a, float b);
float multiply(float a, float b);
float divide(float a, float b);

int main() {
    int choice; // Variable to store user's choice
    float num1, num2; // Variables for numbers entered by user

    // Displaying menu options
    printf("Select operation:\n");
    printf("1. Addition\n");
    printf("2. Subtraction\n");
    printf("3. Multiplication\n");
    printf("4. Division\n");
    printf("Enter choice (1/2/3/4): ");
    scanf("%d", &choice); // User inputs choice

    // Validating input for numbers
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%f %f", &num1, &num2); // Getting two float numbers from the user

    // Switch statement to choose operation
    switch(choice) {
        case 1:
            printf("Result: %.2f\n", add(num1, num2)); // Displaying result
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("Result: %.2f\n", subtract(num1, num2));
            break;
        case 3:
            printf("Result: %.2f\n", multiply(num1, num2));
            break;
        case 4:
            if (num2 != 0) { // Check for division by zero
                printf("Result: %.2f\n", divide(num1, num2));
            } else {
                printf("Error! Division by zero.\n");
            }
            break;
        default:
            printf("Invalid choice! Please select 1-4.\n");
            break;
    }

    return 0; // End of program
}

// Function to add two numbers
float add(float a, float b) {
    return a + b; // Return sum of a and b
}

// Function to subtract two numbers
float subtract(float a, float b) {
    return a - b; // Return difference of a and b
}

// Function to multiply two numbers
float multiply(float a, float b) {
    return a * b; // Return product of a and b
}

// Function to divide two numbers
float divide(float a, float b) {
    return a / b; // Return quotient of a and b
}
```

### 3. Compiling and Running the Program

To compile your program, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your `calculator.c` file, and run:

```bash
gcc calculator.c -o calculator
```

This command compiles the C code and produces an executable named `calculator`. Run the program using the following command:

```bash
./calculator
```

### 4. Understanding the Code

- **Includes and Function Prototypes**: The `#include <stdio.h>` line includes the standard I/O library, which is necessary for using input and output functions like `printf` and `scanf`. We also declare function prototypes for our arithmetic functions.
  
- **Main Function**: The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. We present a menu for the user to choose an operation, take input for two floating-point numbers, and determine the operation to perform using a `switch` statement.

- **Arithmetic Functions**: Each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) is defined as a separate function that takes two parameters and returns the result.

### 5. Enhancing Your Calculator

There are many ways you could extend this simple calculator:
- Implementing additional mathematical functions like square root or exponentiation.
- Adding error handling for invalid inputs.
- Allowing the user to perform multiple calculations in one run.

### Conclusion

This project has provided a hands-on introduction to C programming by guiding you through the process of creating a simple calculator. By understanding the code structure and grasping fundamental programming concepts, you have laid the groundwork for more advanced projects in the future. Remember, programming is a skill that improves with practice, so keep coding!
