### Introduction

With the rapid increase in web application development using PHP, security has become a pressing concern. As a beginner, securing your PHP code is paramount to protect your applications from various vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches and other security threats. This article outlines the best practices for writing secure PHP code. By understanding and implementing these practices, you will significantly reduce the risk associated with your web applications.

### 1. Input Validation

Input validation is the first line of defense in web security. You should always assume that user input can be malicious. Validating and sanitizing input helps protect against threats such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Example of Input Validation:**
```php
// Validate an email address
$email = $_POST['email']; // Obtaining user input
if (filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL) === false) {
    // Handle invalid email address
    die("Invalid email format");
}
```
In the code above, the `filter_var` function checks if the email submitted by the user is valid. If not, an error message is displayed.

### 2. Output Escaping

Output escaping is essential to prevent XSS attacks. This practice involves encoding output before it is sent to the browser, ensuring that special characters are not interpreted as executable code.

**Example of Output Escaping:**
```php
// Escape output using htmlspecialchars
$user_input = "<script>alert('Hacked!');</script>";
echo htmlspecialchars($user_input, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); // Outputs: &lt;script&gt;alert('Hacked!');&lt;/script&gt;
```
The `htmlspecialchars` function converts special characters to HTML entities, making it safe to display user input in the browser.

### 3. Use Prepared Statements for Database Queries

Using prepared statements is crucial when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection attacks. Prepared statements separate SQL logic from data input which improves security.

**Example of Prepared Statements:**
```php
// Create a new PDO instance
$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test', 'username', 'password');

// Prepare an SQL statement
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email');

// Bind parameters
$stmt->bindParam(':email', $email);
$email = $_POST['email']; // User input
$stmt->execute();

// Fetch results
$results = $stmt->fetchAll();
```
In this example, the `:email` parameter serves as a placeholder. It binds the user input to the prepared statement, thus preventing any risk of SQL injection.

### 4. Implement Proper Error Handling

Proper error handling is essential to avoid revealing sensitive information. Avoid displaying detailed error messages to users, as they could expose vulnerabilities.

**Example of Error Handling:**
```php
// Set error reporting level
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', 0); // Do not display errors to users

try {
    // Sample code that may throw an exception
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Log error details instead
    error_log($e->getMessage());
    echo "An error occurred. Please try again later.";
}
```
This approach prevents the exposure of sensitive error information while logging it for the developer's review.

### 5. Regular Updates

Staying up to date with PHP releases and patches is fundamental in maintaining security. Outdated software can contain vulnerabilities that attackers exploit. Make sure to keep your PHP version and all dependencies up to date.

### Conclusion

By following these best practices for writing secure PHP code, you will significantly enhance the security of your web applications. Emphasizing input validation, output escaping, using prepared statements, implementing proper error handling, and maintaining software updates will help provide a safer environment for your users while preventing common vulnerabilities.
