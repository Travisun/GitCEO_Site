### Introduction to Lua

Lua is a powerful and efficient scripting language that has gained immense popularity for its simplicity and flexibility. It is widely used in game development, embedded systems, and even web programming due to its ease of integration with other programming languages. For beginners, understanding the syntax of Lua is crucial, as it forms the foundation for effective coding. In this tutorial, we will explore the basic syntax of Lua, covering essential concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, and functions, providing you with a primer to get started with Lua programming.

### 1. Variables in Lua

In Lua, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. The syntax for declaring a variable is straightforward:

```lua
local variableName = value  -- Declares a variable using local scope
```
- `local`: This keyword indicates that the variable has local scope, meaning it is only accessible within the block where it is declared.
- `variableName`: The name you assign to your variable.
- `value`: The data you want to store in the variable.

For example:

```lua
local name = "John"  -- String variable
local age = 30       -- Number variable
```

### 2. Data Types

Lua supports several built-in data types, including:

- **nil**: Represents an absence of value.
- **boolean**: Represents true or false values.
- **number**: Represents numerical values.
- **string**: Represents sequences of characters.
- **table**: A flexible data structure that can hold arrays, dictionaries, or any other type of data.

To determine the type of a variable, you can use the `type()` function:

```lua
print(type(name))  -- Outputs: string
print(type(age))   -- Outputs: number
```

### 3. Control Structures

Control structures allow you to control the flow of execution in your program. Lua provides several key control structures, including `if`, `for`, and `while` statements.

#### 3.1 If Statement

The `if` statement is used for conditional execution:

```lua
if age >= 18 then  -- Checks if age is greater than or equal to 18
    print(name .. " is an adult.")
else
    print(name .. " is a minor.")
end
```

#### 3.2 For Loop

The `for` loop is used to execute a block of code a specific number of times:

```lua
for i = 1, 5 do  -- Loops from 1 to 5
    print("Iteration: " .. i)
end
```

#### 3.3 While Loop

The `while` loop continues to execute as long as a condition is true:

```lua
local countdown = 5
while countdown > 0 do
    print("Countdown: " .. countdown)
    countdown = countdown - 1
end
```

### 4. Functions

Functions in Lua allow for code reusability and better organization. You can define a function using the following syntax:

```lua
function functionName(parameters)
    -- code to be executed
end
```

For example:

```lua
function greet(name)
    return "Hello, " .. name .. "!"  -- Concatenates strings
end

print(greet("Alice"))  -- Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

### Conclusion
