### Introduction to Socket Programming

Socket programming is a crucial aspect of network development, enabling communication between two or more networked devices. Sockets are endpoints for sending and receiving data across a network, and they form the backbone of various applications, from web servers to chat applications. This project intends to guide beginners through the process of creating a simple command-line tool using sockets in Python, helping them understand the essential concepts and building a foundation for more complex projects.

### 1. Setting Up Your Environment

Before diving into socket programming, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once installed, you can verify it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version  # Check your Python version
```

### 2. Understanding Sockets

A socket can be thought of as a communication channel that allows us to send and receive data. There are two main types of sockets you will work with:

- **Stream Sockets (TCP)**: These provide a reliable, ordered, and error-checked byte stream. They are suitable for applications where data integrity is crucial.
- **Datagram Sockets (UDP)**: These are used for applications that require faster data transmission, such as video streaming or online gaming, but do not require the reliability of TCP.

In our project, we will focus on TCP sockets due to their stability and widespread use in network applications.

### 3. Building the Server

Let’s start by creating a simple server that listens for incoming connections. Create a file called `server.py` and write the following code:

```python
import socket  # Import the socket module

# Create a TCP socket
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)  # IPv4, TCP

# Bind the socket to a specific address and port
server_socket.bind(('127.0.0.1', 65432))  # Localhost and port 65432

# Listen for incoming connections
server_socket.listen()

print("Server is listening on port 65432...")  # Server status message

# Accept a connection
client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()  # Accept a new connection
print(f"Connection established with {address}")  # Output the address of the connected client

# Receive data from the client
data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()  # Receive up to 1024 bytes
print(f"Received message: {data}")  # Output received message

# Close the sockets
client_socket.close()  # Close the client socket
server_socket.close()  # Close the server socket
```

#### Code Explanation

- **socket.socket**: This function creates a new socket. We specify `AF_INET` for IPv4 addressing and `SOCK_STREAM` for TCP.
- **bind**: This method binds the socket to an address and port. The above example binds to `localhost` on port `65432`.
- **listen**: This sets up the server to accept connections.
- **accept**: This method waits for an incoming connection and establishes it, returning a new socket object representing the connection to the client.

### 4. Building the Client

Now let's create a simple client that will connect to our server. Create a file named `client.py` and write the following code:

```python
import socket  # Import the socket module

# Create a TCP socket
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)  # IPv4, TCP

# Connect to the server
client_socket.connect(('127.0.0.1', 65432))  # Connect to localhost on port 65432

# Send a message to the server
message = "Hello, Server!"  # Message to send
client_socket.send(message.encode())  # Send the encoded message

# Close the socket
client_socket.close()  # Close the client socket
```

#### Code Explanation

- **connect**: This method establishes a connection to the server specified by the address and port.
- **send**: This function sends the data to the server. The message is encoded to bytes before sending.

### 5. Running the Programs

To test your socket-based command-line tool, follow these steps:

1. Open two terminal windows.
2. In the first terminal, run the server script:

   ```bash
   python server.py  # Start the server
   ```

3. In the second terminal, run the client script:

   ```bash
   python client.py  # Start the client
   ```

You should see the server print out the message received from the client, confirming that the communication was successful.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we successfully created a basic command-line tool using sockets in Python. We explored both the server and client code, detailing the steps involved in establishing socket communication. This project serves as a foundation for further exploration into network programming, allowing users to build more advanced applications.
