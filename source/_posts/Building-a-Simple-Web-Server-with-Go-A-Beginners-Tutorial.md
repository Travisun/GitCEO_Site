### Introduction to Go and Web Development

Go, commonly referred to as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity and efficiency. It's known for its strong concurrency support, making it an excellent choice for building high-performance applications, including web servers. In this tutorial, we will walk through building a simple web server using Go, providing you with a foundational understanding of both Go and web development principles.

### 1. Setting Up Your Go Environment

Before we start coding, ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Go website at [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/). Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

After installation, create a new directory for your project. Inside your terminal, execute the following commands:

```bash
mkdir go-web-server
cd go-web-server
```

You can verify that Go is installed correctly by running:

```bash
go version
```

### 2. Creating Your Main Go File

Now, let’s create a new file named `main.go`. This file will hold our server code. You can create this file using any text editor of your choice. For example, you might use the command:

```bash
touch main.go
```

### 3. Writing the Web Server Code

Open `main.go` and add the following code:

```go
package main // Define the main package

import (
    "fmt"       // Import fmt for formatted I/O
    "log"       // Import log for logging errors
    "net/http"  // Import net/http for HTTP server functionalities
)

// handler function to handle requests
func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Write response to the browser
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World! You've requested: %s", r.URL.Path) // Respond with a simple message including the requested URL path
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler) // Set the root URL to use the handler function
    fmt.Println("Starting server on :8080") // Notify that the server is starting
    // Start the server on port 8080
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)) // Log any fatal errors
}
```

### 4. Understanding the Code

Let’s go through the code step-by-step:

- **Package Declaration**: We start with `package main`, which defines our main executable package.
- **Importing Packages**: We import required packages:
  - `fmt` for formatted input and output,
  - `log` to log errors, and
  - `net/http` to create the HTTP server.
- **Handler Function**: The `handler` function accepts `http.ResponseWriter` and `http.Request` as parameters. It responds with “Hello, World!” and details about the URL path requested.
- **Main Function**: Inside the main function:
  - We register our handler with `http.HandleFunc("/", handler)`.
  - We start the server on port 8080 with `http.ListenAndServe`.

### 5. Running Your Web Server

To run your web server, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go run main.go
```

When you see the message "Starting server on :8080", your server is up and running. 

### 6. Testing Your Web Server

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see “Hello, World! You’ve requested: /”. 

You can also navigate to different paths like `http://localhost:8080/test` to see how the server handles different requests.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully built a simple web server using Go. In this tutorial, we covered the essential steps to set up your environment, write the server code, and run it. This is just the beginning of what you can do with Go in web development. I encourage you to explore more complex features, such as handling different routes, serving static files, or even accessing a database.
