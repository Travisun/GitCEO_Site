### Introduction to Rust and Game Development

Rust is a systems programming language known for its performance and reliability. It is perfect for game development due to its memory safety features and efficiency. Many developers are drawn to Rust because it combines low-level control with high-level conveniences. In this tutorial, we will explore how to create a simple game using Rust, allowing beginners to understand the game development process while solidifying their Rust programming skills.

### 1. Setting Up Your Environment

To start building games in Rust, you need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

#### 1.1 Install Rust

First, download and install Rust using the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

- This command sets up `rustup`, a toolchain installer for Rust, which will manage Rust versions and associated tools.

#### 1.2 Configure Your Project

Once Rust is installed, create a new project using Cargo, Rust's package manager:

```bash
cargo new simple_game --bin
cd simple_game
```

In this case, `simple_game` will be the name of your project, and `--bin` creates a binary project.

### 2. Building the Game Logic

Now, let's implement the game logic. Our goal is to create a simple text-based number guessing game.

#### 2.1 Modifying `main.rs`

Navigate to the `src` directory and open `main.rs`. We will write the game code in this file. Here is the complete code snippet for our game:

```rust
use std::io; // Importing the standard input/output library
use rand::Rng; // Random number generator library

fn main() {
    // Generating a random number between 1 and 100
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
    println!("Guess the number between 1 and 100!");

    // Initialize a variable to track the user's guess
    loop {
        let mut guess = String::new(); // Create a mutable String for user input

        // Prompting the user for input
        println!("Please input your guess:");

        // Reading the user's guess from standard input
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line"); // Handling potential errors

        // Attempting to convert the guess into a number
        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num, // Successfully parsed, continue
            Err(_) => {
                println!("Please enter a valid number!"); 
                continue; // If parsing fails, ask for input again
            }
        };

        // Check if the user's guess matches the secret number
        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            std::cmp::Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            std::cmp::Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            std::cmp::Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You guessed it! The secret number was {secret_number}.");
                break; // Exit the loop when the guess is correct
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Adding Dependencies

To use the `rand` crate for random number generation, you need to add it to your `Cargo.toml` file. Open `Cargo.toml` and modify it as follows:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8"  # Add this line to include the rand library
```

### 4. Running the Game

Now that everything is set up, you can run your game using the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

This command compiles your project and executes it. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the number guessing game!

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to set up a simple game using Rust, covering the environment setup, game logic implementation, and running the project. By creating this number guessing game, you now have a better understanding of Rust and basic game mechanics. This project is a great starting point for exploring more complex game development concepts in Rust.
