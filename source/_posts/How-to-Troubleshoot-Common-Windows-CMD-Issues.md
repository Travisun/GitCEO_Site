## 1. CMD Not Responding or Crashing

### Symptoms
A user may open CMD, only to find it unresponsive or crashing upon certain commands.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- **Restart CMD**: Close the window and open it again to see if the issue persists.
- **Run as Administrator**: Right-click on the Command Prompt icon and select 'Run as administrator'. This grants elevated privileges and may resolve permission-related issues.
- **Check for Malware**: Perform a full system scan using Windows Defender or another reputable antivirus program, as malware can interfere with CMD operations.

## 2. Command Not Recognized

### Symptoms
You may receive an error message stating that 'command is not recognized as an internal or external command'.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- **Verify Spelling**: Ensure that the command you entered is spelled correctly.
- **Check Path Variables**: Sometimes the command might not be available due to incorrect environment variable settings. 
    - Run the following command to check your PATH variables:
      ```cmd
      echo %PATH%
      ```
    - If the intended command's folder is missing, you may need to add it via:
      - Right-click on 'This PC' -> Properties -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables -> System variables -> PATH -> Edit.
- **Reinstall the Application**: If the command is specific to an application, reinstalling that application might help.

## 3. Permissions Issues

### Symptoms
Certain commands return 'Access Denied' errors.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- **Check User Account Control (UAC)**: Some commands require administrative privileges.
- **Change Permissions**: You can change the permissions of the file or folder by right-clicking it, selecting 'Properties', going to the 'Security' tab, and modifying the permissions.

## 4. CMD Window Closes Automatically

### Symptoms
You try to open CMD, but it immediately closes.

### Troubleshooting Steps
- **Check Startup Programs**: Look for conflicting software that may be set to run at startup.
- **Use Safe Mode**: Boot your computer in Safe Mode and attempt to run CMD from there, which can help bypass other software issues.
