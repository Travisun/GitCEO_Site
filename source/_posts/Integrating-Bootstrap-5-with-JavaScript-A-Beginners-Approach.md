### 1. Setting Up Bootstrap 5

To start using Bootstrap 5, you need to include its CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML document. This can be done via CDN (Content Delivery Network) links. Below are the steps:

#### Step 1: Create a Basic HTML Structure

First, create an `index.html` file and set up the basic HTML structure. Here is an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Bootstrap 5 with JavaScript</title>
    
    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, Bootstrap 5!</h1>
    
    <!-- Bootstrap JS bundle -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
    <script src="script.js"></script> <!-- Link to your custom JS -->
</body>
</html>
```

### 2. Understanding Bootstrap 5 Components

Bootstrap 5 provides a variety of reusable components like buttons, cards, alerts, and modals. Let's take a closer look at how to create a button that triggers a modal window using JavaScript.

#### Step 1: Create a Button and Modal in HTML

Add the following code inside the `<body>` tag to create a button and a modal:

```html
<!-- Button trigger modal -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" id="modalButton">
    Launch Modal
</button>

<!-- Modal -->
<div class="modal fade" id="myModal" tabindex="-1" aria-labelledby="exampleModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
  <div class="modal-dialog">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <div class="modal-header">
        <h5 class="modal-title" id="exampleModalLabel">Modal Title</h5>
        <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        This is a simple modal body.
      </div>
      <div class="modal-footer">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Save changes</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Adding Interactivity with JavaScript

Next, we will write JavaScript code to display the modal when the button is clicked.

#### Step 1: Add Event Listener in JavaScript

Create a `script.js` file and add the following code:

```javascript
// Select the button using its ID
const modalButton = document.getElementById('modalButton');

// Add an event listener to the button
modalButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    // Use Bootstrap's Modal class to show the modal
    const modal = new bootstrap.Modal(document.getElementById('myModal'));
    modal.show(); // Show the modal
});
```

### 4. Customizing Bootstrap Components

You can further customize Bootstrap components using CSS or additional JavaScript options. Bootstrap 5 offers a flexible design that allows developers to modify styles and behavior with minimal effort. For example, you can add custom classes to your buttons and modals for a personalized touch.

### 5. Additional Resources for Further Learning
