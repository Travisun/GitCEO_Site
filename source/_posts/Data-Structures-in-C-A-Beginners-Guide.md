### Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are essential constructs in computer science that allow programmers to store and organize data effectively. When using C++, understanding these structures is crucial for developing efficient algorithms and improving performance. This guide will introduce you to the most common data structures within C++, providing you with practical code examples and explanations to strengthen your understanding.

### 1. Arrays

Arrays are one of the simplest data structures to understand. An array is a collection of elements, all of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. It allows for fast access to its elements through indexing.

#### Example of an Array in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Declare and initialize an array

    // Accessing and printing array elements
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        std::cout << "Element at index " << i << ": " << numbers[i] << std::endl; // Print each element
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Linked Lists

Linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. They are dynamic and allow for efficient insertions and deletions.

#### Example of a Singly Linked List in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Node {
    int data;       // Node data
    Node* next;     // Pointer to the next node
};

// Function to add a new node at the beginning
void push(Node** head_ref, int new_data) {
    Node* new_node = new Node(); // Allocate new node
    new_node->data = new_data;   // Set its data
    new_node->next = (*head_ref); // Link the old list to the new node
    (*head_ref) = new_node;       // Move the head to point to the new node
}

// Function to print the linked list
void printList(Node* node) {
    while (node != nullptr) {
        std::cout << node->data << " "; // Print the node's data
        node = node->next;               // Move to the next node
    }
}

int main() {
    Node* head = nullptr; // Initialize the head of the list

    push(&head, 1); // Push new data
    push(&head, 2);
    push(&head, 3);
    
    std::cout << "Linked List: ";
    printList(head); // Print the linked list
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. You can only add or remove items from the top of the stack.

#### Example of a Stack in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack> // Include stack library

int main() {
    std::stack<int> s; // Create a stack of integers

    // Push elements onto the stack
    s.push(10);
    s.push(20);
    s.push(30);

    std::cout << "Top element is: " << s.top() << std::endl; // Print top element

    s.pop(); // Remove top element

    std::cout << "After popping, top element is: " << s.top() << std::endl; // Print new top element
    return 0;
}
```

### 4. Queues

Queues are also linear data structures but follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This means elements are added at the back and removed from the front.

#### Example of a Queue in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue> // Include queue library

int main() {
    std::queue<int> q; // Create a queue of integers

    // Add elements to the queue
    q.push(10);
    q.push(20);
    q.push(30);

    std::cout << "Front element is: " << q.front() << std::endl; // Print front element

    q.pop(); // Remove front element

    std::cout << "After popping, front element is: " << q.front() << std::endl; // Print new front element
    return 0;
}
```

### 5. Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains a value and can have multiple child nodes. The top node is called the root.

#### Example of a Simple Binary Tree in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Node {
    int data;           // Node data
    Node* left;        // Pointer to left child
    Node* right;       // Pointer to right child

    Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {} // Constructor to initialize node
};

// Function to print the tree in-order
void inorder(Node* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorder(root->left);       // Traverse left subtree
        std::cout << root->data << " "; // Print node data
        inorder(root->right);      // Traverse right subtree
    }
}

int main() {
    Node* root = new Node(1);      // Create root node
    root->left = new Node(2);      // Create left child
    root->right = new Node(3);     // Create right child

    std::cout << "In-order Traversal: ";
    inorder(root); // Perform in-order traversal
    return 0;
}
```
